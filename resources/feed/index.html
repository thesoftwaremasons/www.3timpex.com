					<description><![CDATA[The Preamble Nasarawa State, the home of solid minerals, is rich in exportable products and mineral resources like cassava, groundnut, cowpea, silica [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading article-editor-content__has-focus">The Preamble</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Nasarawa State, <em>the home of solid minerals</em>, is rich in exportable products and mineral resources like cassava, groundnut, cowpea, silica sand, marble, etc, and is a predominantly agricultural state. The State is in the North Central geopolitical zone of Nigeria. It has 13 local government areas including Akwanga, Awe, Doma, Karu, Keana, Keffi, Kokona, Lafia, Nasarawa, Nasarawa Eggon, Obi, Toto, and Wamba with Lafia as the State&#8217;s capital. There are three agricultural zones in Nasarawa state: in the South, Obi, Awe and Doma; in the West, Toto, Kokona, Karu; and in the North, Nasarawa Eggon, Akwanga and Wamba.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Nasarawa state, like other states in Nigeria, should consider export for several reasons some of which include avoiding overdependence on federal allocations, fostering creativity and innovation, identifying and developing state competitive advantage, empowering the working population by creating more jobs, reviving the state economy, boosting the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the state, making farming and rural life more lucrative, and maximising the potential of indigenes in the diaspora.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Regardless of the poverty, unemployment, and frustration present in Nasarawa state like other states in Nigeria due to the inefficient management of state-owned resources, it is imperative to look beyond the challenges, seeing the growth potentials and opportunities for significant improvement that can come from efficient and effective utilisation of available resources.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">For Nasarawa state, there are opportunities in farming, mining and in the state’s population. With the level of unseriousness plaguing many states in Nigeria, cutting down on federal allocations might make the state governments more serious in the development of their states.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">The Peculiarities</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Nasarawa was created out of Plateau State on October 1, 1996, by the General Sani Abacha regime. Its capital is Lafia. Located in the North-Central region of Nigeria, Nasarawa state is bordered to the West by the Federal Capital Territory, to the North by Kaduna, to the South by Benue and Kogi, and to the East by Plateau and Taraba states. The State is nicknamed “Home of Solid Minerals” because of its huge deposits of mineral resources. The state is composed of different ethnic groups each with its own distinct local dialect, but Hausa is common among the people.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">With a total land area of 27,117 Km², Nasarawa state has a population of 2,679,433 of which 1,366,511 are male and 1,312,922 are female. The state has Guinea Savannah vegetation and the major crops grown are Yam, Maize, Cassava, Groundnut, Garden Eggs, Rice, Sorghum, Sugarcane, Pepper, Cowpea, Benniseed, Melon, Soya Beans, Cashew nuts, Sesame Seed, and Shea Butter. The solid minerals present in the state include Barite, Coal, Clay, Lead-Zinc, Sault, Gemstone, Silica Sand, Iron Ore, Granite, Tantalite, Marble, Mica, Cassiterite, Limestone, and Aquamarine. For Nasarawa State, investment opportunities exist in Agribusiness, Light Manufacturing, Healthcare, Tourism, Energy and Mining.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The competitive advantages of Nasarawa State are in it being a strategic location with proximity to the Federal Capital; large arable land (60-70%) for agriculture; high mineral deposits; tourist attraction with an array of hills, waterfalls and rocks; the presence of cargo airport and international markets; the most peaceful state within the region; high-level investment and economic advisory council; investment support and facilitation team in the governor&#8217;s office.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In 2019, the state recorded an Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of N10.9bn and a budget of N100.5bn, implying that the state depends greatly on federal allocations and loans for its survival. In the same period, the unemployment rate in the state was about 29.83%, while about 31.06% were underemployed. With the opportunities available in Nasarawa state, the state can generate enough IGR to solve its internal problems as well as that of the federation, if the resources available in the state can be managed efficiently.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">The Profile</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In 2020, Nasarawa State recorded an IGR of N12.48bn and a Federal Allocation of N47.59bn. This by implication means Nasarawa state cannot survive without an allocation from the federal government which is the reason why the state must work towards tapping into the many resources present in the state. The state in 2020, had a domestic debt of about N59.39bn and foreign debt of about $58.6m and the growth in the state’s debt has been increasing over the years covered except for 2019. About 33.84% of the state’s revenue went to capital expenditure while the remaining 49.79% went to operating expenses. The IGR per capita of the state was N4,385, capital expenditure per capita was N11,892 and debt per capita was N28,700.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">According to the Budgit report of Nigerian states, Nasarawa state, the Home of Solid Minerals performed relatively solid on BudgIT’s 2021 Fiscal performance ranking, as it was able to move from 21st position in 2020 to 16th In 2021. The improvement was due to an improvement in capital spending from the previous year. Nasarawa state grew its capex by 109.13% from N16.17bn in 2019 to N33.83bn in 2020. Looking at capital expenditure per person, it was observed that the state spent about N11,892 per citizen, higher than the national average of N8,129 per citizen.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In terms of sector prioritisation for capital expenditure, Nasarawa spent N18.66bn on its Social Sector, representing 55.14% 55. Of the total N33.84bn spent on capital expenditure. This is significant for human capital development, as the state is spending more on health, education, Women affairs and Youth and Sports What the Civil Society needs to do is ensure that expenditures recorded in the audit report are being used effectively and efficiently.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Nasarawa state’s total operating expenses dropped by 2.79% from N51.22bn in 2019 to N49.79bn in 2020, but this was more than its capital expenditure of N33.83bn. Placing it in the category of 31 states in the country that prioritise spending on operating expenses over capital spending. The most significant reduction in the state’s operating expenses was in Overhead costs which fell from N20.06bn in 2019 to N15.25bn in 2020, representing a 23.75% decrease.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In our analysis of revenue performance, the state did relatively well despite the pandemic- by growing Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) from N10.86bn in 2019 to N12.48bn in 2020, depicting a 14.90% increase. The largest component of this growth came from Pay As You Earn (PAYE) taxes which stood at N9.51bn, representing 76.26% of total IGR for the state in 2020. While direct evidence is needed, it may be speculated that this growth in PAYE collection could be due to an improvement in state capacity to collect taxes, due to Public Financial Management (PFM) reforms. Despite this increase in IGR, Nasarawa is 24th in terms of IGR size for 2020, which means it has ample room to improve its revenue generation capabilities.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Nasarawa’s total debt stock had negative growth of -33.80% from N103.42bn in 2018 to N74.25bn in the 2019 fiscal year, but grew by 5.09% from N74.25bn in 2019 to N81.65bn in 2020 fiscal year. Total debt as at 2020 stands at N81.65bn. In comparison to other states, Nasarawa is the 23rd most indebted state according to the size of its external debt and the 30th by its domestic debt size.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">The Potential</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Farming is the main occupation of the people of the state. It provides food as well as income. Crops produced include cassava, yam, rice, maize, guinea corn, beans, soya beans, beniseed, asha, and millet.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The state also has precious mineral deposits like columbite, a major input in the production of steel; coal, an energy source: and aquamarine, a substance used in the production of jewelleries.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Farming and mining (for tin and columbite) are the principal activities of the area’s predominantly Afo population. Nasarawa is a market centre for yams, sorghum, millet, soybeans, shea nuts, and cotton grown in the surrounding area.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">The Purchasers</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Analysing the global market size for the resources produced by Nasarawa state, it should interest the state to consider enlarging its production capacity to export each product or resource. For example, the world import market size of Corn (which is one of its major cash crops) is about $36.3bn with Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Vietnam, Spain, Egypt, Iran, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, China, and Malaysia as major purchasers. The import market share in Africa is about $3.73bn with Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, South Africa, Senegal, and Kenya as major buyers.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The state also produces Groundnuts, and the world market share of Groundnuts import is $3.19bn with China, the Netherlands, Indonesia, Vietnam, Germany, Russia, Mexico, Canada, the United Kingdom and Thailand as major purchasers. The African import market share is $171m with Algeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda, Libya, and Mozambique as major buyers.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Nasarawa state also produces Rice and the world import market share for Rice is $24.7bn with Iran, China, Saudi Arabia, the Philippines, the United States, Iraq, Benin Republic, United Arab Emirates, Côte D&#8217;Ivoire, and France as major buyers. In Africa, the import is $5.1bn with Benin Republic, Côte D&#8217;Ivoire, South Africa, Senegal, Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya and Mozambique as major purchasers. There are other markets like that of soybeans, cashew nuts (dried and fresh) and sesame seeds that Nasarawa state can explore for exports as well.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">The Proposal</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">For Nasarawa State to experience tangible improvement in job creation in the state, there is a need to empower Small and Medium-scale Enterprises (SMEs). Given the commodities produced by the state, if SMEs oversee the entire value chain processes from production to harvesting and transportation, primary processing and storage, secondary processing and packaging, marketing and sales, logistics, export and distribution then there would be certain challenges encountered which would be in the form of inefficient value chain operators, low processing capacity and output, few jobs created, low-quality packaging, high production cost due to lack of economies of scale and prevalence of unexportable products. With a synergy between large Corporations and SMEs, these processes would be more efficient and there would be improvement which would take the form of efficient value chain operators, high processing capacity and increased output, low cost of production, good product quality and packaging, increased job creation, etc. The large corporations need to oversee two critical areas, and these are primary processing and storage, and secondary processing and packaging. While the SMEs can focus on handling production, harvesting and transport, marketing and sales, and logistics, export and distribution. Sticking to this arrangement would expand the participation of SMEs and improve the efficiency of their processes.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">To support exporters to enter markets in Africa, Europe and America securely and sustainably, Nasarawa state government should consider the following:</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">1. Partnering with a representative at the destination market to market and secure a contract.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">2. Setting up a warehouse (or warehouses) for pickup by both wholesalers and retailers at the destination market</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">3. Setting up an entity (agent or distributor) for the SMEs at the destination market</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">4. Partnering with an independent agent or distributor at the destination market</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">5. Organising and sponsoring manufacturers to exhibit their products in the destination market</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In summary, the state government should provide funds while the other entities provide expertise. After all necessary relationships and structures have been formed, the state government can agree with the SMEs on the export profit-sharing percentage.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">This model&#8217;s impact on the state government goes beyond the generation of revenue from exports; it has a huge significance on employment and improves economic activities in the state. With this model, economic diversification is achievable in Nasarawa state. The same model can be used by the federal government to diversify the economy, especially regarding solid minerals and agricultural produce exportation.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">The Profit</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Given the arable land available in Nasarawa state, if the state dedicates a part of this to the cultivation of profitable agricultural produce for export, given all associated costs from the cost of farming, to the cost of processing, the cost of exports, and the unit cost for each agricultural produce, multiplying this by the quantity produced and deciding on a fair selling price considering all necessary factors, the state government can realise a lot of revenue from the export of agriproducts. By implication, the state can increase its Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) significantly, fund more projects and incur less debt.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">See <a class="article-editor-content__link Hyperlink HyperlinkGateOff SCXW1560340 BCX0" href="https://youtu.be/XYvyPH7rdOc?si=nKs3NN03pu1DlcN-&amp;t=2195" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a> for a hypothetical visual representation and explanation of how Nasarawa state can make N234.5bn from the export of agriproducts (sesame seed).</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In conclusion, if we would diversify our economy, create more trade in Africa, grow our GDP, create employment, boost our foreign reserve, create wealth and reduce poverty, <strong>Aggressive Drive for Intra-Regional Trade is the Way to Go</strong>!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Preamble Rivers State, the treasure base of the nation, is rich in exportable products and mineral resources like cassava, groundnut, cowpea, [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="ember844" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">The Preamble</h3>
<p id="ember845" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Rivers State, the treasure base of the nation, is rich in exportable products and mineral resources like cassava, groundnut, cowpea, silica sand, marble, etc, and is a predominantly agricultural state. The State is in the South-South geopolitical zone of Nigeria. It has 23 local government areas including Abua–Odual, Ahoada East, Ahoada West, Akuku-Toru, Andoni, Asari-Toru, Bonny, Degema, Eleme, Emohua, Etche, Gokana, Ikwerre, Khana, Obio-Akpor, Ogba–Egbema–Ndoni, Ogu–Bolo, Okrika, Omuma, Opobo–Nkoro, Oyigbo, Port Harcourt, and Tai with Port Harcourt as the State&#8217;s capital.</p>
<p id="ember846" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Rivers state, like other states in Nigeria, should consider export for several reasons some of which include avoiding overdependence on federal allocations, fostering creativity and innovation, identifying and developing state competitive advantage, empowering the working population by creating more jobs, reviving the state economy, boosting the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the state, making farming and rural life more lucrative, and maximising the potential of indigenes in the diaspora.</p>
<p id="ember847" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Regardless of the poverty, unemployment, and frustration present in Rivers state like other states in Nigeria due to the inefficient management of state-owned resources, it is imperative to look beyond the challenges, seeing the growth potentials and opportunities for significant improvement that can come from efficient and effective utilisation of available resources.</p>
<p id="ember848" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">For Rivers state, there are opportunities in farming, mining and in the state’s population. With the level of unseriousness plaguing many states in Nigeria, cutting down on federal allocations might make the state governments more serious in the development of their states.</p>
<h3 id="ember849" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">The Peculiarities</h3>
<p id="ember850" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Rivers State was created out of the former Eastern Region on 27th May 1967 by the then regime of General Yakubu Gowon. Bayels State was carved out of it in the state creation excercise of 1996. It’s capital and biggest city is Port Harcourt.</p>
<p id="ember851" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">The State is in Southern Nigeria, and it covers 11,077 km². The inland part of Rivers state consists of tropical rainforest; towards the coast the typical river Rivers environment features many mangrove swamps. Rivers state was part of the Oil Rivers Protectorate from 1885 till 1893, when it became part of the Niger Coast Protectorate. In 1900 the region was merged with the chartered territories of the Royal Niger Company to form the colony of Southern Nigeria.</p>
<p id="ember852" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Port Harcourt is its capital city and regarded as the Centre of Nigeria’s oil and gas industry. Rivers State is bounded on the South by the Atlantic Ocean, to the North by Imo, Abia and Anambra States, to the East by Akwa Ibom State, and to the West by Bayelsa and Delta states.</p>
<p id="ember853" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Rivers State is nicknamed the “Treasure Base of the Nation” is on Nigeria’s coastline and has a number of seaports. Prior to the discovery of oil in Rivers State, Agriculture was the mainstay of its economy. About 39 percent of the state’s total land mass is suitable for crop cultivation. Rivers State also has a lucrative fishing industry.</p>
<p id="ember854" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">With a total land area of 11,077 km², Rivers state has a population of 7,817,866 of which 3,987,112 are male and 3,830,755 are female. The state has Tropical Rainforest and Monsoon vegetation and the major crops grown are Cassava, Rubber, Oil Palm, Coconut, Raffia Palm, Rice, Yam, Maize, Watermelon and Vegetables. The solid minerals present in the state include Crude oil, Silica, Glass Sand and Clay. For Niger State, investment opportunities exist in Agribusiness, Light Manufacturing, Healthcare, Tourism, Energy and Mining.</p>
<p id="ember855" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">The competitive advantages of Rivers State are it having large deposits of crude oil; second largest seaport in Nigeria; 3rd largest oil-producing state in Nigeria; centre of the Nigeria oil and gas industry; tourism and wildlife (Finima Nature Park); biggest oil refinery in Nigeria.</p>
<p id="ember856" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">In 2019, the state recorded an Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of N140.4bn and a budget of N530.8bn, implying that the state depends largely on federal allocations and loans for its survival. In the same period, the unemployment rate in the state was about 41.59%, while about 17.63% were underemployed. With the opportunities available in Rivers state, the state can generate IGR enough to solve its internal problems as well as that of the federation, if the resources available in the state can be managed efficiently.</p>
<h3 id="ember857" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">The Profile</h3>
<p id="ember858" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">In 2020, Rivers State recorded an IGR of N117.19bn and a Federal Allocation of N149.75bn. This by implication means Rivers state can, to a reasonable extent, match up to the federal allocation it receives, however, there is still much work to be done to ensure the resources present in the state are well utilised. The state in 2020, had a domestic debt of about N266.94bn and foreign debt of about $96.7m and the growth in the state’s debt has been increasing over the years covered except for 2019. About 59.70% of the state’s revenue went to capital expenditure while the remaining 40.30% went to operating expenses. The IGR per capita of the state was N14,005, capital expenditure per capita was N20,120 and debt per capita was N36,291.</p>
<p id="ember859" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">According to the Budgit report of Nigerian state, Once again, the “Treasure Base of the Nation” retains its position at the top of the 2021 States’ Fiscal Performance Index, despite shocks from the COVID-19 Pandemic to its revenue. Year-on-year, its IGR saw a decline of-16.53%, from N140.4bn in 2019 to N117.2bn in 2020.</p>
<p id="ember860" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Nevertheless, the state’s IGR was still the second highest in the country and accounted for 9.65% of the total N1.21tn in IGR generated by all 36 states; it was surpassed only by Lagos state with an IGR of N418.98bn in 2020.</p>
<p id="ember861" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">The state will need to work hard in further boosting its IGR especially as headwinds from the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected federally distributed revenue, causing the state’s Gross FAAC allocated to decline by -11.46%, from N169.13bn in 2019 to N149.7bn in 2020. Although crude oil prices are recovering, the global push for energy transition from fossil fuels like crude oil to clean energy, means the days of relatively easy oil revenue are numbered.</p>
<p id="ember862" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Rivers state’s capital expenditure declined by -24.14% from N221.9bn in 2019 to N168.4bn in 2020. However, for the second year in a row, the state still emerged as one of the 5 states in the country that prioritized capital infrastructure spending over operating expenses; the latter received only N113.6bn.</p>
<p id="ember863" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Furthermore, of the state’s N168.4bn capital expenditure, the economic sector received the highest priority with N85.28bn, followed by ‘Special Heads’ which received N31.46bn. The Social Sector, Administrative Sector and Law/Justice sector received N23.94bn, N20.46bn and N7.21bn respectively.</p>
<p id="ember864" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">The state also had the 3rd highest per capita spending on capital expenditure of N20,120 exceeded only by Ebonyi and Lagos States with a per capita spending of N23,608 and N21,895, respectively. However, knowledge about the actual quality of expenditure and value for money obtained from them would benefit from further analysis.</p>
<p id="ember865" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Preliminary evaluations indicate that the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health received N2.8bn and N1.5bn, respectively for capital expenditure, while the Rivers State Government House received N27.7bn for capital expenditures through Security Vote’ envelope in addition to another N16.1bn received through the main Government House capital expenditures envelope. Furthermore, the social sector received only N20.46bn, a significant-63.07% decline from N64.84bn spent in 2019.</p>
<h3 id="ember867" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">The Potential</h3>
<p id="ember868" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Prior to the discovery of oil in commercial quantity in 1951, Agriculture was the primary occupation of the people of Rivers State.</p>
<p id="ember869" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Around the 19th century when the industrial revolution reached its peak in England, the area was then referred to as Oil Rivers Protectorate, this was due to its abundant palm oil and kernel which basically constituted the main revenue source of the country. In a sample survey carried out by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, about 40% of the rural inhabitants were committed to farming in 1983.</p>
<p id="ember870" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Rivers State is one of the leading states in the production of yam, cassava, cocoyam, maize, rice and beans. About 39% (760,000 hectares) of the state’s total land mass, particularly in the upland area, is suitable for cultivation.</p>
<p id="ember871" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Major cash crops produced are oil palm products, rubber, coconut, raffia palm and jute. Other crops grown for food include vegetables, melon, pineapples, mango, pepper, banana and plantain.</p>
<p id="ember872" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">The fishing industry is an important sector in Rivers State. Besides being lucrative, fishing is also a favourite past time activity. There are approximately 270 species of fish existing; with many artisanal fishermen in the riverine areas. The state provides valuable seafood such as crabs, oysters, shrimps and sea snails among others. Vertebrates like birds, mammals and reptiles are also found in the region.</p>
<p id="ember873" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Fishing and farming are the principal occupations of the region. Plantains, bananas, cassava, oil palms, coconuts, rubber trees, raffia, and citrus fruits are grown. Large deposits of crude oil and natural gas in the Niger River delta are the state’s major mineral resources. Major oil terminals exist offshore from Brass and Bonny, and petroleum refineries have been established at Port Harcourt and nearby Alesa-Eleme. Port Harcourt, the state capital and one of the nation’s largest ports, is on the southern terminus of the eastern branch of the Nigerian Railway’s main line.</p>
<h3 id="ember874" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">The Purchasers</h3>
<p id="ember875" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Analysing the global market size for the resources produced by Rivers state, it should interest the state to consider enlarging its production capacity to export each product or resource. For example, the world import market size of Corn (which is one of its major cash crops) is about $36.3bn with Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Vietnam, Spain, Egypt, Iran, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, China, and Malaysia as major purchasers. The import market share in Africa is about $3.73bn with Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, South Africa, Senegal, and Kenya as major buyers.</p>
<p id="ember876" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">The state also produces Palm Oil, and the world market share of Palm Oil import is $29.3bn with India, China, Pakistan, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy and the United States as major purchasers. The African import market share is $4.28m with R Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, South Africa, Benin Republic and Ghana as major buyers.</p>
<p id="ember877" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Rivers state also produces Rice and the world import market share for Rice is $24.7bn with Iran, China, Saudi Arabia, the Philippines, the United States, Iraq, Benin Republic, United Arab Emirates, Côte D&#8217;Ivoire, and France as major buyers. In Africa, the import is $5.1bn with Benin Republic, Côte D&#8217;Ivoire, South Africa, Senegal, Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya and Mozambique as major purchasers. There are other markets like that of sorghum, millet and groundnut that Rivers state can explore for exports as well.</p>
<h3 id="ember878" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">The Proposal</h3>
<p id="ember879" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">For Rivers State to experience tangible improvement in job creation in the state, there is a need to empower Small and Medium-scale Enterprises (SMEs). Given the commodities produced by the state, if SMEs oversee the entire value chain processes from production to harvesting and transportation, primary processing and storage, secondary processing and packaging, marketing and sales, logistics, export and distribution then there would be certain challenges encountered which would be in the form of inefficient value chain operators, low processing capacity and output, few jobs created, low-quality packaging, high production cost due to lack of economies of scale and prevalence of unexportable products. With a synergy between large Corporations and SMEs, these processes would be more efficient and there would be improvement which would take the form of efficient value chain operators, high processing capacity and increased output, low cost of production, good product quality and packaging, increased job creation, etc. The large corporations need to oversee two critical areas, and these are primary processing and storage, and secondary processing and packaging. While the SMEs can focus on handling production, harvesting and transport, marketing and sales, and logistics, export and distribution. Sticking to this arrangement would expand the participation of SMEs and improve the efficiency of their processes.</p>
<p id="ember880" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">To support exporters to enter markets in Africa, Europe and America securely and sustainably, Rivers state government should consider the following:</p>
<p id="ember881" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">1. Partnering with a representative at the destination market to market and secure a contract.</p>
<p id="ember882" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">2. Setting up a warehouse (or warehouses) for pickup by both wholesalers and retailers at the destination market</p>
<p id="ember883" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">3. Setting up an entity (agent or distributor) for the SMEs at the destination market</p>
<p id="ember884" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">4. Partnering with an independent agent or distributor at the destination market</p>
<p id="ember885" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">5. Organising and sponsoring manufacturers to exhibit their products in the destination market</p>
<p id="ember886" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">In summary, the state government should provide funds while the other entities provide expertise. After all necessary relationships and structures have been formed, the state government can agree with the SMEs on the export profit-sharing percentage.</p>
<p id="ember887" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">This model&#8217;s impact on the state government goes beyond the generation of revenue from exports; it has a huge significance on employment and improves economic activities in the state. With this model, economic diversification is achievable in Rivers state. The same model can be used by the federal government to diversify the economy, especially regarding solid minerals and agricultural produce exportation.</p>
<h3 id="ember888" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">The Profit</h3>
<p id="ember889" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Given the arable land available in Rivers state, if the state dedicates a part of this to the cultivation of profitable agricultural produce for export, given all associated costs from the cost of farming, to the cost of processing, the cost of exports, and the unit cost for each agricultural produce, multiplying this by the quantity produced and deciding on a fair selling price considering all necessary factors, the state government can realise a lot of revenue from the export of agriproducts. By implication, the state can increase its Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) significantly, fund more projects and incur less debt.</p>
<p id="ember890" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">See <a class="pTSsSJsLzRLkMbyTaIxqYJTfuyzbqtZqJVgQ " href="https://youtu.be/mopbWjSlggc?t=2673&amp;si=Td08QHNOUFNIL76E" target="_self" data-test-app-aware-link="" rel="noopener">here</a>for a hypothetical visual representation and explanation of how Rivers state can make N949bn from the export of agriproducts (shea butter).</p>
<p id="ember891" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">In conclusion, if we would diversify our economy, create more trade in Africa, grow our GDP, create employment, boost our foreign reserve, create wealth and reduce poverty, Aggressive Drive for Intra-Regional Trade is the Way to Go!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Preamble Ondo State, the Sunshine State, is rich in exportable products and mineral resources like corn, cocoa, rubber, bitumen, columbite, etc, [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="ember1321" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">The Preamble</h3>
<p id="ember1322" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Ondo State, <em>the Sunshine State</em>, is rich in exportable products and mineral resources like corn, cocoa, rubber, bitumen, columbite, etc, and is a predominantly agricultural state. The State is in the Southwestern geopolitical zone of Nigeria. It has 18 Local Government Areas (LGAs) including Akoko North-East, Akoko North-West, Akoko South-East, Akoko South-West, Akure North, Akure South, Ese Odo, Idanre, Ifedore, Ilaje, Okeigbo, Irele, Odigbo, Okitipupa, Ondo East, Ondo West, Ose and Owo with its capital in Akure. It has 3 main LGAs include Akoko, Akure, Okitipupa, Ondo, Ilaje, Idanre and Owo.</p>
<p id="ember1323" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Ondo state, like other states in Nigeria, should consider export for several reasons some of which include avoiding overdependence on federal allocations, fostering creativity and innovation, identifying and developing state competitive advantage, empowering the working population by creating more jobs, reviving the state economy, boosting the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the state, making farming and rural life more lucrative, and maximising the potential of indigenes in the diaspora.</p>
<p id="ember1324" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Regardless of the poverty, unemployment, and frustration present in Ondo state like other states in Nigeria due to the inefficient management of state-owned resources, it is imperative to look beyond the challenges, seeing the growth potentials and opportunities for significant improvement that can come from efficient and effective utilisation of available resources.</p>
<p id="ember1325" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">For Ondo state, there are opportunities in farming, mining and in the state’s population. With the level of unseriousness plaguing many states in Nigeria, cutting down on federal allocations might make the state governments more serious in the development of their states.</p>
<h3 id="ember1326" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">The Peculiarities</h3>
<p id="ember1327" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Ondo State was created on 3 February 1976 from the former Western State by the then regime of General Murtala Mohammed. It originally included what is now Ekiti State, which was split off in the state creation exercise of 1996. Akure is the state capital. The economy of Ondo State is the sixth largest in Nigeria and is dominated by crude oil and crop production.</p>
<p id="ember1328" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Ondo State produces more than 75,000 tons of quality cocoa annually, has the largest Bitumen deposit in Africa and has the longest coastline in Nigeria 180km.</p>
<p id="ember1329" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Ondo State is bounded in the East by Edo and Delta States, in the North by Ekiti and Kogi States, in the West by Osun and Ogun States and in the South by the Atlantic Ocean. The ethnic composition of Ondo State is largely from the Yoruba subgroups of the Akoko, Akure, Ikare, Ilaje, Ondo, Owo, Arogbos and Akpois who are Ijaw extraction and are mostly located in the Riverine areas of the state. The State also contains the largest number of public schools in Nigeria – over 880 primary schools and 190 secondary schools.</p>
<p id="ember1330" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">With a total land area of 15,500 Km², Ondo state has a population of 4,960,577 of which 2,529,894 are male and 2,430,683 are female. The state has Tropical Savannah and Monsoon vegetation and the major crops grown are Cocoyam, Rubber, Oil Palm, Cashew, and Cocoa. The solid minerals present in the state include Bitumen, Timber, Crude oil, Limestone, Granite, Coal, and Columbite. For Ondo State, investment opportunities exist in Agribusiness, Light Manufacturing, Healthcare, Tourism, Energy, Mining and Logistics.</p>
<p id="ember1331" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">The competitive advantages of Ondo State are it having 75,000+ tons of quality cocoa annually; the largest bitumen deposit in Africa; true deep-sea port co-located with a free-trade zone; second longest defined coastline of 75km; natural transit hub to Nigeria&#8217;s hinterlands; fertile land and water for agriculture.</p>
<p id="ember1332" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">In 2019, the state recorded an Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of N30.1bn and a budget of N187.8bn, implying that the state depends greatly on federal allocations and loans for its survival. In the same period, the unemployment rate in the state was about 17.09%, while about 24.16% were underemployed. With the opportunities available in Ondo state, the state can generate IGR enough to solve its internal problems as well as that of the federation, if the resources available in the state can be managed efficiently.</p>
<h3 id="ember1333" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">The Profile</h3>
<p id="ember1334" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">In 2020, Ondo State recorded an IGR of N24.85bn and a Federal Allocation of N62.75bn. This by implication means Ondo state cannot survive without an allocation from the federal government which is the reason why the state must work towards tapping into the many resources present in the state. The state in 2020, had a domestic debt of about N74.66bn and foreign debt of about $87.4m and the growth in the state’s debt has been increasing over the years covered except for 2019. About 29.12% of the state’s revenue went to capital expenditure while the remaining 92.69% went to operating expenses. The IGR per capita of the state was N4,717, capital expenditure per capita was N5,529 and debt per capita was N20,483.</p>
<p id="ember1335" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">According to the Budgit report of Nigerian states, The Sunshine State, Ondo, emerged 30th in the 2021 Fiscal Performance Ranking, down -6 places from 24th position in 2020. This drop was due to a fall in its IGR and reduced priority placed on capital expenditure during the fiscal year. The state’s IGR dropped by – 17.55% from N30.14bn in 2019 to N24.85bn in 2020.</p>
<p id="ember1336" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Income taxes (PAYE) declined by -15.48% or N2.66bn from N17.18bn in 2019 to N14.52bn in 2020, while Road Taxes saw an uptick of 35.71% from N790m in 2019 to N1.07bn in 2020, making it one of only 14 states in the country to see its road taxes grow as the COVID-19 pandemic ravaged local economies across the country.</p>
<p id="ember1337" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Nevertheless, given its population, it still needs to work hard to boost its internally generated revenue; this will go a long way in reducing the risk of further indebtedness.</p>
<p id="ember1338" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">The state’s total revenue for 2020 was N119.19bn, this is an increase of 23.07% from 2019 N96 85bn. Ondo state cannot fund both its recurrent and capital expenditures with its revenue unless it goes the route of debt.</p>
<p id="ember1339" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">The state’s expenditure profile includes N92.69bn on operating expenses, N29.12bn on capital expenditures and N21.00bn on loan repayments, bringing its total expenditure to N142.81bn. Whereas, the state had total revenue inflows (including Aids &amp; Grants) of N119.19bn, an Opening Balance as at January 1, 2021, of N25.23bn and proceeds from long-term borrowings of N15.2bn.</p>
<p id="ember1340" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">The best the state can do is to cut down its operating expenses or the state needs to reign in its operating expense which grew by 11.65% from N86.24bn in 2019 to N92.69bn in 2020. In contrast, the state’s capital expenditures declined slightly by -4.68% from N30.55bn in 2019 to N29.12bn in 2020. This state needs to invest more in capital infrastructure as its operating expenses of N92.69bn in 2020 were more than three times its capital expenditure of N29.12bn. Its capital expenditure per capita stands at N5,529 which is way lower than the average capital expenditure per capita of N8,129.</p>
<p id="ember1341" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Ondo state’s total debt has been on a gradual increase in the past five years, rising by 64.33% from N65.65n in 2016 to N107.89bn in 2020; year-on-year it’s total debt grew by 16.12% from N92.83bn in 2019 to N107.89bn in 2020, but it still holds the status of having the smallest debt profile in the entire South West region.</p>
<h3 id="ember1342" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">The Potential</h3>
<p id="ember1343" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Agriculture (including fishing) constitutes the main occupation of the people of the state. Indeed, Ondo state is the leading cocoa-producing state in Nigeria. Other agricultural products include yams, cassava and palm produce.</p>
<p id="ember1344" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Major industries in Ondo State include Nigeria/Romania Wood Industries in Ondo, the Okitipupa Oil Palm Mill, Alpha Industries, Arigidi-Akoko, Cocoa Processing factory, lle-Oluji, Oluwa Glass Company, Igbokoda and the Premier Metal Industry, Ondo.</p>
<p id="ember1345" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, and the chief products are cotton and tobacco from the north, cacao from the central part, and rubber and timber (teak and hardwoods) from the south and east; palm oil and kernels are cultivated for export throughout the state.</p>
<p id="ember1346" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Ondo is Nigeria’s chief cocoa-producing state. Other crops include rice, yams, corn (maize), coffee, taro, cassava (manioc), vegetables, and fruits. Traditional industries include pottery making, cloth weaving, tailoring, carpentry, and blacksmithing. Mineral deposits include kaolin, pyrites, iron ore, petroleum, and coal.</p>
<h3 id="ember1347" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">The Purchasers</h3>
<p id="ember1348" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Analysing the global market size for the resources produced by Ondo state, it should interest the state to consider enlarging its production capacity to export each product or resource. For example, the world import market size of Corn (which is one of its major cash crops) is about $36.3bn with Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Vietnam, Spain, Egypt, Iran, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, China, and Malaysia as major purchasers. The import market share in Africa is about $3.73bn with Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, South Africa, Senegal, and Kenya as major buyers.</p>
<p id="ember1349" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">The state also produces Cassava, and the world market share of Cassava import is $2.11bn with China, Thailand, Vietnam, the Netherlands, Germany, France, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, France and Belgium as major purchasers. The African import market share is $19m with Rwanda, Burundi, Nigeria, Mauritania, Namibia, Botswana, and Comoros as major buyers.</p>
<p id="ember1350" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Ondo state also produces Rice and the world import market share for Rice is $24.7bn with Iran, China, Saudi Arabia, the Philippines, the United States, Iraq, Benin Republic, United Arab Emirates, Côte D&#8217;Ivoire, and France as major buyers. In Africa, the import is $5.1bn with Benin Republic, Côte D&#8217;Ivoire, South Africa, Senegal, Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya and Mozambique as major purchasers. There are other markets like that of cocoa beans, palm oil, rubber, and cashew nuts (fresh or dried) that Ondo state can explore for exports as well.</p>
<h3 id="ember1351" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">The Proposal</h3>
<p id="ember1352" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">For Ondo State to experience tangible improvement in job creation in the state, there is a need to empower Small and Medium-scale Enterprises (SMEs). Given the commodities produced by the state, if SMEs oversee the entire value chain processes from production to harvesting and transportation, primary processing and storage, secondary processing and packaging, marketing and sales, logistics, export and distribution then there would be certain challenges encountered which would be in the form of inefficient value chain operators, low processing capacity and output, few jobs created, low-quality packaging, high production cost due to lack of economies of scale and prevalence of unexportable products.

					<description><![CDATA[The Preamble Ogun State, the Gateway State, is rich in exportable products and mineral resources like maize, cotton, oil palm, bauxite, timber, [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="ember964" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">The Preamble</h3>
<p id="ember965" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Ogun State, <em>the Gateway State</em>, is rich in exportable products and mineral resources like maize, cotton, oil palm, bauxite, timber, etc, and is a predominantly agricultural state. The State is in the Southwestern geopolitical zone of Nigeria. It has 20 local government areas including Abeokuta North, Abeokuta South, Ota, Ewekoro, Ifo, ljebu East, Ijebu North, Ijebu Northeast, ljebu Ode, Ikenne, Imeko Afon, Ipokia, Obafemi Owode, Odogbolu, Odeda, Ogun Waterside, Remo North, Sagamu, Yewa North and Yewa South with Abeokuta as the State&#8217;s capital.</p>
<p id="ember966" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Ogun state, like other states in Nigeria, should consider export for several reasons some of which include avoiding overdependence on federal allocations, fostering creativity and innovation, identifying and developing state competitive advantage, empowering the working population by creating more jobs, reviving the state economy, boosting the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the state, making farming and rural life more lucrative, and maximising the potential of indigenes in the diaspora.</p>
<p id="ember967" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Regardless of the poverty, unemployment, and frustration present in Ogun state like other states in Nigeria due to the inefficient management of state-owned resources, it is imperative to look beyond the challenges, seeing the growth potentials and opportunities for significant improvement that can come from efficient and effective utilisation of available resources.</p>
<p id="ember968" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">For Ogun state, there are opportunities in farming, mining and in the state’s population. With the level of unseriousness plaguing many states in Nigeria, cutting down on federal allocations might make the state governments more serious in the development of their states.</p>
<h3 id="ember969" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">The Peculiarities</h3>
<p id="ember970" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Ogun State referred to as the “<em>Gateway State</em>”, located in the South-Western region of Nigeria, was created on 3 February 1976. It borders Lagos State to the South, Oyo and Osun states to the North, Ondo to the East and the Republic of Benin to the West.</p>
<p id="ember971" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">The state has the largest deposit of limestone in Nigeria. Its unique comparative advantage is its strategic closeness to Lagos State, thereby attracting many investments to the State. It has Abeokuta as its capital and largest city. Ogun State also has the highest number of registered universities in Nigeria (nine in all) as well as five new private universities in the state. Most of the inhabitants of Ogun state are members of the Egba and Egbado subgroups of the Yoruba people.</p>
<p id="ember972" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Abeokuta, an important market centre, is a terminus of the roads and railways coming from Lagos and other parts of the country. Major tourist attractions are Olumo rock, which according to tradition provided refuge for early Egba settlers; the Ake, the residence of the Alake (the traditional ruler of Egbaland), built in 1854 and noted for its collection of antiquities and relics; and the Centenary Hall, all in Abeokuta.</p>
<p id="ember973" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">With a total land area of 16,762 Km², Ogun state has a population of 5,573,704 of which 2,842,589 are male and 2,731,115 are female. The state has tropical savannah vegetation and the major crops grown are Maize, Cocoa, Oil Palm, Rice, Cassava, and Cotton. The solid minerals present in the state include Limestone, Bauxite, Bitumen, Timber, and Gemstones. For Niger State, investment opportunities exist in Agribusiness, Light Manufacturing, Healthcare, Tourism, Energy, ICT and Mining.</p>
<p id="ember974" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">The competitive advantages of Ogun State are its access to the largest road network with strategic links to other regions of Nigeria; access to Nigerian and West African markets; availability of 74% arable land; home to 3 of the largest industrial zones in the country; availability of gas – 65% for industrial purposes; 30% contribution to national solid minerals; home to 20+ tertiary institutions.</p>
<p id="ember975" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">In 2019, the state recorded an Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of N70.9bn and a budget of N449.9bn, implying that the state depends greatly on federal allocations and loans for its survival. In the same period, the unemployment rate in the state was about 16.36, while about 9.87% were underemployed. With the opportunities available in Ogun state, the state can generate IGR enough to solve its internal problems as well as that of the federation, if the resources available in the state can be managed efficiently.</p>
<h3 id="ember976" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">The Profile</h3>
<p id="ember977" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">In 2020, Ogun State recorded an IGR of N50.75bn and a Federal Allocation of N51.44bn. Ogun state, like many other states in Nigeria, cannot survive without an allocation from the federal government which is the reason why the state must work towards tapping into the many resources present in the state. The state in 2020, had a domestic debt of about N153.49bn and foreign debt of about $103.5m and the growth in the state’s debt has been increasing over the years covered except for 2019. About 24.83% of the state’s revenue went to capital expenditure while the remaining 75.17% went to operating expenses. The IGR per capita of the state was N8,524, capital expenditure per capita was N5,120 and debt per capita was N32,385.</p>
<p id="ember978" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">According to the Budgit report of Nigerian states. The Gateway State emerged 19th on the 2021 Fiscal Performance Ranking down 16 places from the 3rd position in 2020. This steep downward slide was driven mainly by a significant decline in its Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) which fell by 28.44% or N20.17bn from N70.92bn earned in 2019 to N50.75bn earned in 2020.</p>
<p id="ember979" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">All components of its IGR (Road Taxes, MDAs Revenue, Direct Assessment, Other Taxes) witnessed a downturn except for income taxes (PAYE) which increased marginally by 4.65% from N24.30bn in 2019 to N25.03bn in 2020. This makes the state one of 18 states in the country that were not resilient enough to survive COVID-19-induced fiscal shocks to their internally generated revenue. Nevertheless, the state still had the second largest IGR in the South West region, behind only Lagos State and had the 5th largest IGR in Nigeria. However, this is not good enough given its population size, diverse economic potential and infrastructure needs.</p>
<p id="ember980" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">The total revenue in 2020 fell by 44.26%, from N195.76bn in 2019 to N109.12bn in 2020. The IGR accounted for 46.51% (nearly half) of its total revenue in 2020, while the remaining balance of 42.61% came from statutory allocations, VAT and other sources (e.g. Aids and Grants).</p>
<p id="ember981" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Ogun State cut its capital spending by 13.92% from N35.42bn in 2019 to N30.49bn in 2020, making it one of 19 states to deprioritize capital expenditure as COVID-19 ravaged their revenue sources. The state’s capital expenditure per capita stood at N5,120 per citizen, significantly lower than the country average per capita spending of N8,129 for all 36 states.</p>
<p id="ember982" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Ogun State is ranked 7th most indebted state out of the 36 states with a total debt stock stood at N192.82bn as of December 31, 2020, up by 11.41% from N173.07bn in 2019. Domestic debt increased by 7.87% from N142.29bn in 2019 to N153.49bn in 2020 while its external debt experienced a slower growth recording an upturn of 2.86%, from $100.61m in 2019 to $103.49m in 2020.</p>
<h3 id="ember983" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">The Potential</h3>
<p id="ember984" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Its natural resources include an extensive fertile soil suitable for agriculture and mineral deposits. The climate and soil of the state are suitable for the cultivation of a wide range of crops. The major food crops include rice, maize, cassava, yam and banana. The main cash crops include cocoa, kolanut, rubber, palm oil and palm kernels. Ogun State is one of the largest producers of kolanut in the country. It also produces timber and rubber on a large scale. About 20% of its total area is constituted of forest reserve suitable for livestock.</p>
<p id="ember985" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">The State has enormous industrial potential. Its natural resources, manpower and geographical proximity to Lagos make it a potential industrial zone for the nation. Its extensive limestone deposit according to scientists can last for some five hundred years. The multi-million naira cement factory in Sagamu is the largest in West Africa. Both this factory and the Ewekoro Cement factory depend on the local limestone resources for raw materials. Other mineral resources available include chalk, phosphate, high-quality stones and gravels for construction works. There are also other modern industries producing high-quality beer, bicycle tyres, ceramic goods, high-quality clay bricks, carpet and clothing materials.</p>
<p id="ember986" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Agriculture, the economic mainstay of Ogun, produces rice, corn (maize), cassava (manioc), yams, plantains, and bananas. Cocoa, kola nuts, rubber, palm oil and palm kernels, tobacco, cotton, and timber are the main cash crops.</p>
<p id="ember987" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">The Aro granite quarries near Abeokuta, the state capital, provide building material for much of southern Nigeria. Mineral resources include limestone, chalk, phosphates, and clay. Industries produce cement, canned foods, foam rubber, paint, tyres, carpets, aluminium products, and plastics.</p>
<h3 id="ember988" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">The Purchasers</h3>
<p id="ember989" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Analysing the global market size for the resources produced by Ogun state, it should interest the state to consider enlarging its production capacity to export each product or resource. For example, the world import market size of Corn (which is one of its major cash crops) is about $36.3bn with Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Vietnam, Spain, Egypt, Iran, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, China, and Malaysia as major purchasers. The import market share in Africa is about $3.73bn with Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, South Africa, Senegal, and Kenya as major buyers.</p>
<p id="ember990" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">The state also produces Rice, and the world market share of Rice import is $24.7bn with Iran, China, Saudi Arabia, the Philippines, the United States, Iraq, Benin Republic, United Arab Emirates, Côte D&#8217;Ivoire, and France as major purchasers. The African import market share is $5.1bn with Benin Republic, Côte D&#8217;Ivoire, South Africa, Senegal, Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya and Mozambique as major buyers.</p>
<p id="ember991" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Ogun state also produces Cassava and the world import market share for Cassava is $2.11bn with China, Thailand, Vietnam, the Netherlands, Germany, France, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, France and Belgium as major buyers. In Africa, the import is $19m with Rwanda, Burundi, Nigeria, Mauritania, Namibia, Botswana, and Comoros as major purchasers. There are other markets like that of cocoa beans and palm oil that Ogun state can explore for exports as well.</p>
<h3 id="ember992" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">The Proposal</h3>
<p id="ember993" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">For Ogun State to experience tangible improvement in job creation in the state, there is a need to empower Small and Medium-scale Enterprises (SMEs). Given the commodities produced by the state, if SMEs oversee the entire value chain processes from production to harvesting and transportation, primary processing and storage, secondary processing and packaging, marketing and sales, logistics, export and distribution then there would be certain challenges encountered which would be in the form of inefficient value chain operators, low processing capacity and output, few jobs created, low-quality packaging, high production cost due to lack of economies of scale and prevalence of unexportable products. With a synergy between large Corporations and SMEs, these processes would be more efficient and there would be improvement which would take the form of efficient value chain operators, high processing capacity and increased output, low cost of production, good product quality and packaging, increased job creation, etc. The large corporations need to oversee two critical areas, and these are primary processing and storage, and secondary processing and packaging. While the SMEs can focus on handling production, harvesting and transport, marketing and sales, and logistics, export and distribution. Sticking to this arrangement would expand the participation of SMEs and improve the efficiency of their processes.</p>
<p id="ember994" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">To support exporters to enter markets in Africa, Europe and America securely and sustainably, Ogun state government should consider the following:</p>
<p id="ember995" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">1. Partnering with a representative at the destination market to market and secure a contract.</p>
<p id="ember996" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">2. Setting up a warehouse (or warehouses) for pickup by both wholesalers and retailers at the destination market</p>
<p id="ember997" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">3. Setting up an entity (agent or distributor) for the SMEs at the destination market</p>
<p id="ember998" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">4. Partnering with an independent agent or distributor at the destination market</p>
<p id="ember999" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">5. Organising and sponsoring manufacturers to exhibit their products in the destination market</p>
<p id="ember1000" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">In summary, the state government should provide funds while the other entities provide expertise. After all necessary relationships and structures have been formed, the state government can agree with the SMEs on the export profit-sharing percentage.</p>
<p id="ember1001" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">This model&#8217;s impact on the state government goes beyond the generation of revenue from exports; it has a huge significance on employment and improves economic activities in the state. With this model, economic diversification is achievable in Ogun state. The federal government can use the same model to diversify the economy, especially regarding solid minerals and agricultural produce exportation.</p>
<h3 id="ember1002" class="ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3">The Profit</h3>
<p id="ember1003" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">Given the arable land available in Ogun state, if the state dedicates a part of this to the cultivation of profitable agricultural produce for export, given all associated costs from the cost of farming, to the cost of processing, the cost of exports, and the unit cost for each agricultural produce, multiplying this by the quantity produced and deciding on a fair selling price considering all necessary factors, the state government can realise a lot of revenue from the export of agriproducts. By implication, the state can increase its Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) significantly, fund more projects and incur less debt.</p>
<p id="ember1004" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">See <a class="app-aware-link " href="https://youtu.be/KMBV7JGz8EA?si=Yh-4iaY_rScv54n4&amp;t=2839" target="_self" data-test-app-aware-link="" rel="noopener">here</a> for a hypothetical visual representation and explanation of how Ogun state can make N316bn from the export of agriproducts (cocoa).</p>
<p id="ember1005" class="ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph">In conclusion, if we would diversify our economy, create more trade in Africa, grow our GDP, create employment, boost our foreign reserve, create wealth and reduce poverty, <strong>Aggressive Drive for Intra-Regional Trade is the Way to Go</strong>!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading article-editor-content__has-focus">The Preamble</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Niger State, <em>the power state</em>, is rich in exportable products and mineral resources like cassava, groundnut, cowpea, silica sand, marble, etc, and is a predominantly agricultural state. The State is in the North Central geopolitical zone of Nigeria. It has 25 local government areas including Agaie, Agwara, Bida, Borgu, Bosso, Chanchaga, Edati, Gbako, Gurara, Katcha, Kontagora, Lapai, Lavun, Magama, Mariga, Mashegu, Mokwa, Munya, Paikoro, Rafi, Rijau, Shiroro, Suleja, Tafa, and Wushishi with Minna as the State&#8217;s capital. It has 3 main cities Bida, Kontagora, and Suleja.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Niger state, like other states in Nigeria, should consider export for several reasons some of which include avoiding overdependence on federal allocations, fostering creativity and innovation, identifying and developing state competitive advantage, empowering the working population by creating more jobs, reviving the state economy, boosting the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the state, making farming and rural life more lucrative, and maximising the potential of indigenes in the diaspora.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Regardless of the poverty, unemployment, and frustration present in Niger state like other states in Nigeria due to the inefficient management of state-owned resources, it is imperative to look beyond the challenges, seeing the growth potentials and opportunities for significant improvement that can come from efficient and effective utilisation of available resources.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">For Niger State, there are opportunities in farming, mining and in the state’s population. With the level of unseriousness plaguing many states in Nigeria, cutting down on federal allocations might make the state governments more serious in the development of their states.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">The Peculiarities</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Niger State was created the then Northwestern State on 3rd February 1976 by the then regime of General Murtala Mohammed. It has Minna as its capital. Other major cities are Bida, Kontagora, and Suleja.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The State is bordered to the North by Zamfara State, West by Kebbi State, South by Kogi State, South-West by Kwara State, Northeast by Kaduna State and Southeast by FCT. The State also has an International Boundary with the Republic of Benin along Agwara and Borgu LGAs to the Northwest, thereby promoting trade relations.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The state has the largest landmass with about 70% arable and cultivable land. It is nicknamed “Power State” as being home to three (3) hydroelectric dams that generate about 70% combined power output in the Nation’s Power Sector.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Located in the Middle Belt of Nigeria, Niger State covers 76,363 square kilometres. It is the largest Nigerian state by land area.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The state has a small majority of Muslims. The state is named for the River Niger.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Two of Nigeria’s major hydroelectric power stations are in Niger State: The Kainji Dam and the Shiroro Dam. Kainji National Park is also situated in Niger State. It contains the lake formed by the Kainji dam. It is the largest National Park in Nigeria, but a lot of the wildlife has disappeared.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Niger State shares boundaries with Kaduna State and Federal Capital Territory, Abuja States in the East and South-East respectively, Kebbi and Zamfara in the North, Kwara and Kogi States in the South and Benin Republic in the East.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The areas making up Niger State today comprised the old Nupe and Kontogora Kingdos, Abuja (now Suleja) with links to the famous kingdom of Zauzau and a host of other political entities.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The old Nupe Kingdom today has been broken administratively into the Bida Emirate (encompassing Gbako and Lavun Local Government areas) and the Agaie and Lapai emirates.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Similarly, old Kontagora now comprises Kontagora emirates within which there is the chiefdom of the territories of Sarkin Bauchi and the Chiefdom of Kagara, all administratively grouped into the Mariga, Magama and Rafi Local Governments.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">With a total land area of 76,363 Km², Niger state has a population of 5,947,214 of which 3,033,079 are male and 2,914,135 are female. The state has a Sudan savannah vegetation and the major crops grown are yam, Cassava, Shea Butter, Sorghum, Maize, Millet, Rice, Groundnut, Cashew and Cowpea. The solid minerals present in the state include Talc, Gold, Ball Clays, Silica Sand, Marble, Copper, Iron, Feldspar, Lead, Kaolin, Casserole, Columbite, Mica, Quartzite and Limestone. For Niger State, investment opportunities exist in Agribusiness, Light Manufacturing, Healthcare, Tourism, Energy, ICT and Mining.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The competitive advantages of Niger State are it being the largest state in Nigeria covering over 10% of the country&#8217;s land mass; 70-80% cultivatable land; large arable land for all kinds of crop production; at least one mineral resource present in each local government; largest tourists&#8217; sites in the countries with over 60 tourists&#8217; sites; number 1 producer of yams, sugarcane and melon seeds.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In 2019, the state recorded an Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of N12.8bn and a budget of N155bn, implying that the state depends greatly on federal allocations and loans for its survival. In the same period, the unemployment rate in the state was about 38.80%, while about 23.44% were underemployed. With the opportunities available in Niger state, the state can generate IGR enough to solve its internal problems as well as that of the federation, if the resources available in the state can be managed efficiently.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">The Profile</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In 2020, Niger State recorded an IGR of N10.52bn and a Federal Allocation of N60.90bn. This by implication means Niger state cannot survive without an allocation from the federal government which is the reason why the state must work towards tapping into the many resources present in the state. The state in 2020, had a domestic debt of about N66.78bn and foreign debt of about $71m and the growth in the state’s debt has been increasing over the years covered except for 2019. About 43.26% of the state’s revenue went to capital expenditure while the remaining 60.69% went to operating expenses. The IGR per capita of the state was N1,653, capital expenditure per capita was N6,796 and debt per capita was N14,726.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">According to the Budgit report of Nigerian states, <em>the Power State</em> performed relatively weak on the BudgIT fiscal performance ranking. Niger fell from its 19th position in 2020 to 26th position in 2021. This poor performance was despite some considerable increase in capital expenditure growth between 2019 and 2020.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">It was also despite a near stagnancy in the state’s total actual recurrent expenditure, as the latter only slightly rose by a mere 0.044%, from N60.41bn in 2019 to N60.68bn in 2020. However, despite this slight rise, the total Overhead Costs’ fell by about N6.62bn, from N18.26bn in 2019 to N11.64bn in 2020.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In addition, the pandemic created new lines of spending, namely ‘Covid Personal Allowances’ and ‘Covid Related Overheads’, both of which were N4,50bn and N1.56bn, respectively.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Moving our focus to capital expenditure, we observed that Niger state’s allocations grew by 33.62%, from N32.37bn in 2019 to N43.25bn in 2020. This made the state the 9th highest in terms of capital expenditure (capex) allocations in the entire federation. Comparing this capex spend to recurrent expenditure spend, one can notice that capex is at least N17bn less than recurrent expenditure. The state’s capex per capita is N6,796, which is less than the national average of N8,129 per capita.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In terms of revenue performance, Niger State is the 4th lowest in the federation at N1,653 per capita, while the national average is N4,616 per capita. The state’s Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) shrank by 17.55%, when it moved from N12.76bn in 2019, to N10.52bn in 2020. The largest subcomponent of IGR came from ‘MDAs revenue’, where it climbed from N463.2m in 2019, to N1.77bn in 2020, a growth of 282%. This can be contrasted with the fall in ‘Other taxes’, which was N7.02bn in 2019 and then moved downward to N3.13bn in 2020, depicting a 55.41% decrease.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The state’s total debt stock grew by 26.19% from N60.55bn in 2018 to N82.03bn in the 2019 fiscal year but slowed down to 12.69% in the 2019-2020 fiscal year, growing from N82.03bn to N93.74bn. The state’s total debt per capita stands at N14,726, lower than the country average total debt per capita of N27,316.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">The Potential</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Generally, agricultural activities form the mainstay of the people’s economy and engage directly or indirectly more than 80% of the population.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The economy of Niger is based largely on internal markets, subsistence agriculture, and the export of raw commodities: foodstuffs to neighbours and raw minerals to world markets. Niger, a landlocked West African nation that straddles the Sahel, has consistently been ranked at the bottom of the Human development index, with a relatively low GDP and per capita income, and ranks among the least developed and most heavily indebted countries in the world, despite having large raw commodities and a relatively stable government and society not currently affected by civil war or terrorism. Economic activity centres on subsistence agriculture, animal husbandry, re-export trade, and export of uranium.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The 50% devaluation of the West African CFA franc in January 1994 boosted exports of livestock, cowpeas, onions, and the products of Niger’s small cotton industry. Exports of cattle to neighbouring countries, including groundnuts and oil, remain the primary non-mineral exports. The government relies on bilateral and multilateral aid – which was suspended briefly following coups d’état in 1996 and 1999- for operating expenses and public investment. Short-term prospects depend on continued World Bank and IMF debt relief and extended aid. The post-1999 government has broadly adhered to privatization and market deregulation plans instituted by these funders.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Niger’s economy is based largely on subsistence crops, livestock, and some of the world’s largest uranium deposits. Drought cycles, desertification, a 3.4% population growth rate and the drop in world demand for uranium have undercut an already marginal economy. Traditional subsistence farming, herding, small trading, and informal markets dominate an economy that generates few formal sector jobs. Between 1988 and 1995 28% to 30% of the total economy of Niger was in the unregulated Informal sector, including small and even large-scale rural and urban production, transport and services.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">The Purchasers</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Analysing the global market size for the resources produced by Niger state, it should interest the state to consider enlarging its production capacity to export each product or resource. For example, the world import market size of Corn (which is one of its major cash crops) is about $36.3bn with Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Vietnam, Spain, Egypt, Iran, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, China, and Malaysia as major purchasers. The import market share in Africa is about $3.73bn with Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, South Africa, Senegal, and Kenya as major buyers.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The state also produces Cassava, and the world market share of Cassava import is $2.11bn with China, Thailand, Vietnam, the Netherlands, Germany, France, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, France and Belgium as major purchasers. The African import market share is $19m with Rwanda, Burundi, Nigeria, Mauritania, Namibia, Botswana, and Comoros as major buyers.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Niger state also produces Rice and the world import market share for Rice is $24.7bn with Iran, China, Saudi Arabia, the Philippines, the United States, Iraq, Benin Republic, United Arab Emirates, Côte D&#8217;Ivoire, and France as major buyers. In Africa, the import is $5.1bn with Benin Republic, Côte D&#8217;Ivoire, South Africa, Senegal, Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya and Mozambique as major purchasers. There are other markets like that of sorghum, millet and groundnut that Niger state can explore for exports as well.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">The Proposal</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">For Niger State to experience tangible improvement in job creation in the state, there is a need to empower Small and Medium-scale Enterprises (SMEs). Given the commodities produced by the state, if SMEs oversee the entire value chain processes from production to harvesting and transportation, primary processing and storage, secondary processing and packaging, marketing and sales, logistics, export and distribution then there would be certain challenges encountered which would be in the form of inefficient value chain operators, low processing capacity and output, few jobs created, low-quality packaging, high production cost due to lack of economies of scale and prevalence of unexportable products. With a synergy between large Corporations and SMEs, these processes would be more efficient and there would be improvement which would take the form of efficient value chain operators, high processing capacity and increased output, low cost of production, good product quality and packaging, increased job creation, etc. The large corporations need to oversee two critical areas, and these are primary processing and storage, and secondary processing and packaging. While the SMEs can focus on handling production, harvesting and transport, marketing and sales, and logistics, export and distribution. Sticking to this arrangement would expand the participation of SMEs and improve the efficiency of their processes.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">To support exporters to enter markets in Africa, Europe and America securely and sustainably, Niger state government should consider the following:</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">1. Partnering with a representative at the destination market to market and secure a contract.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">2. Setting up a warehouse (or warehouses) for pickup by both wholesalers and retailers at the destination market</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">3. Setting up an entity (agent or distributor) for the SMEs at the destination market</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">4. Partnering with an independent agent or distributor at the destination market</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">5. Organising and sponsoring manufacturers to exhibit their products in the destination market</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In summary, the state government should provide funds while the other entities provide expertise. After all necessary relationships and structures have been formed, the state government can agree with the SMEs on the export profit-sharing percentage.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">This model&#8217;s impact on the state government goes beyond the generation of revenue from exports; it has a huge significance on employment and improves economic activities in the state. With this model, economic diversification is achievable in Niger state. The same model can be used by the federal government to diversify the economy, especially regarding solid minerals and agricultural produce exportation.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">The Profit</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Given the arable land available in Niger state, if the state dedicates a part of this to the cultivation of profitable agricultural produce for export, given all associated costs from the cost of farming, to the cost of processing, the cost of exports, and the unit cost for each agricultural produce, multiplying this by the quantity produced and deciding on a fair selling price considering all necessary factors, the state government can realise a lot of revenue from the export of agriproducts. By implication, the state can increase its Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) significantly, fund more projects and incur less debt.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading article-editor-content__has-focus">The Preamble</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Lagos State, <em>the Centre of Excellence</em>, even though less agricultural compared to other Nigerian states, has some exportable commodities and mineral resources like rice, coconut, yam, fish, silica sand, bitumen, etc, and is a predominantly agricultural state. The State is in the Southwestern geopolitical zone of Nigeria. With 5 administrative divisions (Ikorodu, Ikeja, Epe, Badagry and Lagos Island), Lagos has 20 local government areas (LGAs) with 16 Urban areas and 4 Rural areas. In addition to the LGAs, the state has 37 Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs) in charge of taxation, schooling and health at a closer level to the people. The local government areas in the state include Agege, Alimosho, Apapa, Ifako-Ijaye, Ikeja, Kosofe, Mushin, Oshodi-Isolo, Shomolu, Eti-Osa, Lagos Island, Lagos Mainland, Surulere, Ojo, Ajeromi-Ifelodun, Amuwo-Odofin, Badagry, Ikorodu, Ibeju-Lekki, and Epe with its capital in Ikeja. Although the state is the smallest in Nigeria, it has the largest urban population.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Lagos state, like other states in Nigeria, should consider export for several reasons some of which include avoiding overdependence on federal allocations, fostering creativity and innovation, identifying and developing state competitive advantage, empowering the working population by creating more jobs, reviving the state economy, boosting the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the state, making farming and rural life more lucrative, and maximising the potential of indigenes in the diaspora.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Regardless of the hardship, unemployment, and frustration present in Lagos state like other states in Nigeria due to the inefficient management of state-owned resources, it is imperative to look beyond the challenges, seeing the growth potentials and opportunities for significant improvement that can come from efficient and effective utilisation of available resources.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">For Lagos state, there are opportunities in farming, mining and in the state’s population. With the level of unseriousness plaguing many states in Nigeria, cutting down on federal allocations might make the state governments more serious in the development of their states.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><em>The Peculiarities </em></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Lagos State was created out of the former western region by the General Yakubu Gowon regime. Its capital is Ikeja. Prior to this, Lagos Municipality had been administered by the Federal Government through the Federal Ministry of Lagos Affairs as the regional authority, while the Lagos City Council (LCC) governed the City of Lagos. Equally, the metropolitan areas (Colony Province) of Ikeja, Agege, Mushin, Ikorodu, Epe and Badagry were administered by the Western Region.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Lagos State shares boundaries with Ogun State both in the North and East and is bounded on the west by the Republic of Benin. In the South, it stretches for 180 kilometres along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean. Being the smallest State in Nigeria, Lagos State consists of lagoons and creeks.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The State took off as an administrative entity on April 11, 1968, with Lagos Island serving the dual role of being the State and Federal Capital. However, with the creation of the Federal Capital Territory of Abuja, Lagos ceased to be the capital of Nigeria and the state&#8217;s capital was moved to Ikeja. Notwithstanding, Lagos remains the nation’s economic and commercial capital.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Lagos State is inhabited by the Aworis and Ogus in Ikeja and Badagry Divisions respectively, with the Ogus being found mainly in Badagry. While the Indigenous population of Lagos are Aworis, there is, nevertheless, a mixture of other pioneer immigrant settlers collectively called Lagosians but more appropriately the Ekos.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">With a total land area of 3,345 Km², Lagos state has a population of 13,380,098 of which 6,823,850 are male and 6,556,248 are female. The state has a tropical savannah vegetation and the major crops grown are yam, coconut, palm oil and vegetables. The solid minerals present in the state include Clay, Bitumen and Silica Sand.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The competitive advantages of Lagos State are in it being the g7th fastest growing city in the world; the main economic, financial and industrial hub in Nigeria; the highest GDP and IGR in Nigeria; the largest concentration of young, skilled and educated workforce in Nigeria; largest tourism and entertainment industry in Africa; best city for startups in Africa.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In 2019, the state recorded an Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of N398.7bn and a budget of N1.2tn. Looking at the composition of the state&#8217;s expenses, the state can indeed cater for its operating expenses which was about 300bn without support from the Federal government. However, the state is still dependent on the federal government and loans to augment its needs. In the same period, the unemployment rate in the state was about 37.14%, while about 4.52% were underemployed. The unemployment rate is that high because many people do not possess the skills required to take on such roles even though there are jobs available. With the opportunities available in Lagos state, the state can generate IGR enough to solve its internal problems as well as that of the federation, if the resources available in the state can be managed efficiently.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">The Profile</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In 2020, Lagos State recorded an IGR of N418.99bn which was a significant increase compared to 2019 even with the impact of Covid-19 in 2020. The Federal Allocation in the same year was N182.88bn. Lagos state is one of the most viable states in Nigeria and if in any case, it doesn&#8217;t get allocations from the Federal government, the state can still function to a good extent. Despite this achievement, there is still much that the state can do to improve its earnings. The state in 2020, had a domestic debt of about N508.78bn and foreign debt of about $1,406.5m which is really huge. The growth in the state’s debt has been increasing over the years covered except for 2019. About 55.89% of the state’s revenue went to capital expenditure while the remaining 44.11% went to operating expenses. The IGR per capita of the state was N29,373, capital expenditure per capita was N21,895 and debt per capita was N73,136.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">According to the Budgit report of Nigerian states, Despite being the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic and exposed to the risk of fiscal shocks to its revenue, Lagos state emerged in 4th position in the 2021 Fiscal Performance Ranking, demonstrating its resilience with a total revenue of N658.56bn for the fiscal year 2020. The state saw a 5.08% growth in its IGR from N398.73bn in 2019 to N418.99bn39 in 2020 and was one of 18 states to see a growth in its IGR despite the fiscal storm induced by COVID-19.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The growth in IGR was driven largely by a 31.43% growth in MDAs Revenue from N39.41bn in 2019 to N51.79bn in 2020 followed by a 3.31% or N8.92bn growth in income taxes (PAYE) from N269.96bn in 2019 to N278bn in 2020. However, we note that this growth in income taxes is slower than the 12.74% or N30.51bn growth from N239.45bn recorded in 2018 to N269.96bn in 2019. Overall, the state had an IGR per capita of N29,373, more than five times the country average of N4,616 per citizen.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Lagos State saw a 24.38% or N2.38bn growth in the Road Taxes component of its IGR from N9.76bn in 2019 to N12.13bn in 2020. An analysis of the state’s recurrent revenue component of its total revenue indicates that 70% was obtained from its internally generated revenue while 30% was received from statutory allocation making the state the least dependent on federally distributed revenue in the country.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The Center of Excellence has not lost sight of capital investments that could increase the quality of life of citizens and it was one of the 17 states in the country to increase its investment in capital infrastructure, growing its actual capital spending by 26.52% from N241.06bn in 2019 to N304.99bn in 2020. A breakdown of capital spending indicates that expenditure on Economic Affairs increased by 43.27% from N108.63bn in 2019 to N155.63bn in 2020, while that on education increased by 144.30% from N7.11bn in 2019 to N17.37bn in 2020. Overall, the state had a capital expenditure per capita of N21,895, which is more than 2 times the country average of N8,129 and the second-highest per capita spending in 2020.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">On the operating expenses spectrum of the state’s expenditure, it cut down spending on General and Administrative by -38.95% ог N63.96bn from N164.23bn in 2019 to N100.27bn in 2020. With a total debt burden of N1.04tn, up by 19.73% from N871.33bn in 2019, Lagos State is the most indebted state out of the 36 states. It also has the highest external debt of $1.41bn, giving it the highest exposure to risks of exchange rate volatility. Domestic debt increased by 14.53% from N444.23bn in 2019 to N508.78bn in 2020.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">The Potential</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Lagos State, with GDP currently estimated at $91bn (dropping from $131 due to forex fluctuations) is currently Africa’s 5th largest economy. Lagos with an estimated population of 21 Million is the most populous city in Nigeria and the seventh fastest growing city in the world.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Lagos State is the nation’s economic and financial nerve and is currently home to 65 per cent of Nigeria’s businesses, with a presence of over 2,000 manufacturing companies, 200 financial institutions and the largest collection of small and medium enterprises in Africa.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Lagos is also the major Information Communications and Telecommunications (ICT) hub of West Africa and potentially, the biggest ICT market in the continent. Lagos is developing a 24-hour economy in line with its goal to become a world-class megacity.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Two of the nation’s largest seaports-Apapa and Tin-Can Ports are located in Lagos State. Lagos is also Nigeria’s aviation hub.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Lagos is the centre of the Nigerian movie industry, often referred to as ‘Nollywood’. Idumota market on Lagos Island is the primary distribution centre. Many films are shot in the Festac area of Lagos. Lagos is also home to Nigeria’s growing music industry showcasing world-class talents that are winning awards in Africa and on the world stage.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">The Purchasers</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Analysing the global market size for the resources produced by Lagos state, it should interest the state to consider enlarging its production capacity to export each product or resource. For example, the world import market size of Processed Fish (which is one of the major foods produced in the state) is about $17.9bn with the United States, Japan, Italy, Germany, France, Spain, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Australia and Canada as major purchasers. The import market share in Africa is about $1.13bn with Libya, Egypt, South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, Algeria, Cote d&#8217;Ivoire, and Gabon as major buyers.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The state also produces Lake Rice, and the world market share of Rice import is $24.7bn with Iran, China, Saudi Arabia, the Philippines, the United States, Iraq, Benin Republic, United Arab Emirates, Côte D&#8217;Ivoire, and France as major purchasers. The African import market share is $5.1bn with Benin Republic, Côte D&#8217;Ivoire, South Africa, Senegal, Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya and Mozambique as major buyers.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Lagos state also produces Frozen Vegetables and the world import market share for Frozen Vegetables is $6.89bn with, Vietnam, the United States, Japan, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Italy, South Korea and the Netherlands as major buyers. In Africa, the import is $109m with Algeria, South Africa, Botswana, Libya, Egypt, Namibia, Mauritius and Eswatini as major purchasers. There are other markets like that of frozen vegetables that Lagos state can explore for exports as well.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">The Proposal</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">People might have questions about &#8220;what does Lagos State have to do with agriculture?” but interestingly, Lagos State has a very strong support for agriculture in the form of training, equipment, etc. Although there isn&#8217;t much farming going on in the state, the little the state does, it tries to pay attention to it. Such information might not be common knowledge since you mostly find what you&#8217;re looking for. For example, in the Agege area of Lagos, Lagos has. Some things do with a Greek in that space.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">For Lagos State to improve the number of jobs created in the state, there is a need to empower Small and Medium-scale Enterprises (SMEs) more. Given the commodities produced by the state, if SMEs oversee the entire value chain processes from production to harvesting and transportation, primary processing and storage, secondary processing and packaging, marketing and sales, logistics, export and distribution then there would be certain challenges encountered which would be in the form of inefficient value chain operators, low processing capacity and output, few jobs created, low-quality packaging, high production cost due to lack of economies of scale and prevalence of unexportable products. With a synergy between large Corporations and SMEs, these processes would be more efficient and there would be improvement which would take the form of efficient value chain operators, high processing capacity and increased output, low cost of production, good product quality and packaging, increased job creation, etc. The large corporations need to oversee two critical areas, and these are primary processing and storage, and secondary processing and packaging. While the SMEs can focus on handling production, harvesting and transport, marketing and sales, and logistics, export and distribution. Sticking to this arrangement would expand the participation of SMEs and improve the efficiency of their processes.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">To support exporters to enter markets in Africa, Europe and America securely and sustainably, Lagos state government should consider the following:</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">1. Partnering with a representative at the destination market to market and secure a contract.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">2. Setting up a warehouse (or warehouses) for pickup by both wholesalers and retailers at the destination market</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">3. Setting up an entity (agent or distributor) for the SMEs at the destination market</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">4. Partnering with an independent agent or distributor at the destination market</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">5. Organising and sponsoring manufacturers to exhibit their products in the destination market</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In summary, the state government should provide funds while the other entities provide expertise. After all necessary relationships and structures have been formed, the state government can agree with the SMEs on the export profit-sharing percentage.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">This model&#8217;s impact on the state government goes beyond the generation of revenue from exports; it has a huge significance on employment and improves economic activities in the state. With this model, economic diversification is achievable in Lagos state. The same model can be used by the federal government to diversify the economy, especially regarding solid minerals and agricultural produce exportation.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">The Profit</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Given the arable land available in Lagos state, if the state dedicates a part of this to the cultivation of profitable agricultural produce for export, given all associated costs from the cost of farming, to the cost of processing, the cost of exports, and the unit cost for each agricultural produce, multiplying this by the quantity produced and deciding on a fair selling price considering all necessary factors, the state government can realise a lot of revenue from the export of agriproducts. By implication, the state can increase its Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) significantly, fund more projects and incur less debt.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Preamble Kwara State, the state of harmony, is rich in exportable products and mineral resources like rice, sesame, cashew, silica sand, [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading article-editor-content__has-focus">The Preamble</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Kwara State, <em>the state of harmony</em>, is rich in exportable products and mineral resources like rice, sesame, cashew, silica sand, dolomite, etc, and is a predominantly agricultural state. The State is in the North Central geopolitical zone of Nigeria. It has 16 local government areas including Asa, Baruten, Edu, Ekiti, Ifelodun, Ilorin East, Ilorin South, Ilorin West, Irepodun, Isin, Kaiama, Moro, Offa, Oke Ero, Oyun, and Pategi with its capital in Ilorin.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Kwara state, like other states in Nigeria, should consider export for several reasons some of which include avoiding overdependence on federal allocations, fostering creativity and innovation, identifying and developing state competitive advantage, empowering the working population by creating more jobs, reviving the state economy, boosting the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the state, making farming and rural life more lucrative, and maximising the potential of indigenes in the diaspora.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Regardless of the poverty, unemployment, and frustration present in Kwara state like other states in Nigeria due to the inefficient management of state-owned resources, it is imperative to look beyond the challenges, seeing the growth potentials and opportunities for significant improvement that can come from efficient and effective utilisation of available resources.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">For Kwara state, there are opportunities in farming, mining and in the state’s population. With the level of unseriousness plaguing many states in Nigeria, cutting down on federal allocations might make the state governments more serious in the development of their states.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">The Peculiarities</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Kwara State was formed out of the former northern region on 27th May 1967 by the General Yakubu Gowon regime. At its creation, the state was made up of the former llorin and Kabba provinces of the then Northern Region and was initially named the West Central State but later changed to Kwara, a local name for the River Niger.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Kwara State is bounded in the north by Niger State, in the south by Oyo, Osun and Ekiti States, in the east by Kogi State and in the west by Benin Republic. Because of its unique geographical position, the State is referred to as the “gateway” between the north and the south of the country. The main ethnic groups are Yoruba, Fulani, Nupe and Barubas. While Islam and Christianity are the major religions in the state. The major occupation of the people of Kwara state is farming as agriculture is the main source of the economy.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">With a total land area of 36,825 Km², Kwara state has a population of 3,390,330 of which 1,729,068 are male and 1,661,262 are female. The state has a tropical savannah vegetation and the major crops grown are Rice, Cotton, Cocoa, Tomato, Sugarcane, Millet, Cassava, Soya Bean, Maize, Beniseed (sesame seed), Palm Produce and Ginger. The solid minerals present in the state include Quartz, Limestone, Marble, Feldspar, Clay, Kaolin, Granite Rocks, Silica Sand and Dolomite. For Kwara State, investment opportunities exist in Agribusiness, Manufacturing, Tourism, and Mining.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The competitive advantages of Kwara State are in it being the gateway to the north and south; availability of international airport and cargo terminal; key agricultural-based research institutes; high deposits of mineral resources; and tourist attraction sites (Owu waterfalls, one of the highest in West Africa).</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In 2019, the state recorded an Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of N30.6bn and a budget of N162bn, implying that the state depends greatly on federal allocations and loans for its survival. In the same period, the unemployment rate in the state was about 16.55%, while about 19.16% were underemployed. With the opportunities available in Kwara state, the state can generate IGR enough to solve its internal problems as well as that of the federation, if the resources available in the state can be managed efficiently.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">The Profile</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In 2020, Kwara State recorded an IGR of N19.60bn and a Federal Allocation of N47.17bn. This by implication means Kwara state cannot survive without an allocation from the federal government which is the reason why the state must work towards tapping into the many resources present in the state. The state in 2020, had a domestic debt of about N63.63bn and foreign debt of about $47.1m and the growth in the state’s debt has been increasing over the years covered except for 2019. About 30.65% of the state’s revenue went to capital expenditure while the remaining 69.35% went to operating expenses. The IGR per capita of the state was N5,446, capital expenditure per capita was N6,272 and debt per capita was N22,644.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">According to the Budgit report of Nigerian state, The ‘State of Harmony’ may have achieved some level of fiscal ‘harmony’, as it was able to move from 12th position on BudgIT’s fiscal performance ranking in 2020, to 10th position in 2021. Kwara state is the best performing state within the north-central region and has maintained a decent position. Kwara’s recurrent expenditure also dropped year-on-year by 28.64% between the same fiscal year, moving from N71.59bn in 2019 to N51.08bn in 2020.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The state reduced its capital expenditure year-on-year between 2019 and 2020 from N29.87bn to N22.57bn, at 24.43%. Noting the state’s capital expenditure performance, it is observed that Kwara was the 9th lowest spender on Capital expenditure in 2020, when ranked alongside the states of the federation. In terms of capital expenditure per capita, Kwara spent N6,272 per citizen in 2020, which is below the national average capital expenditure per capita of N8,129 per citizen and slightly lower than the national median capex per capita of N6,612 per citizen.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In terms of Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) performance, the state did not perform well and had a percentage decrease of 36.03%, being a move from N30.64bn in 2019 to N19.60bn in 2020. Kwara state had the 3rd worst decline (comparing by percentage) in IGR. The components of Kwara’s IGR show that the largest negative change was recorded in ‘MDAs Revenue’, which dropped from N17.35bn in 2019 to N10.32bn in 2020, representing a 40.51% reduction. Yet, Kwara still had the highest IGR within its region in 2020, exceeding Plateau State by nearly N500m (Plateau had an IGR of N19.12bn in 2020).</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The state’s debt profile is relatively low, as its total debt stock had a minimal increase of 4.51% in the 2018-2019 fiscal year and grew by 5.15% in the 2019-2020 fiscal year. Total debt from 2018 to 2020 ran from N73.96bn to N77.45bn to N81.51bn. For foreign debt, the state owed N14.40bn but due to the April 2020 Central Bank of Nigeria exchange rate devaluation (from N306 to N380), foreign debt increased by approximately N3.48bn to N17.88bn. In comparison to its fellow sub-national units, Kwara is the 8th least indebted state in the federation.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">The Potential</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy and the principal cash crops are cotton, cocoa, coffee, kolanut, tobacco, benseed, cashew nuts and palm produce. The Agricultural institutes located in the state are the Agricultural and Rural Management Training Institute, (ARMTI), the National Centre for Agricultural Mechanisation and Niger River Basin Authority all located in llorin and the Agricultural Research Project of the Obafemi Awolowo University at Balla provide farmers with vital information on modern agricultural techniques.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">There is also an abundance of mineral resources in the state. Among these are limestone, marble, feldspar, clay, kaolin, quartz and granite rocks. Industries in the state include Kwara Breweries, ljagbo Global Soap and Detergent Industry. United Match Company, Tate and Lyle Company, Resinoplast Plastic Industry, Phamatech Nigeria Limited, Kwara Textile and Kwara Furniture Company all in llorin. Others are Paper Manufacturing Industry, Jebba, Okin Foam and Okin Biscuits, Offa, Kay Plastic, Ganmo and Kwara Paper Converters Limited Enin-De. Others are the Sugar Producing Company, Bacita, Kwara Animal Feed Mall, Ilorin and the Agricultural Products Company, Bacita.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The Major crops include Rice, Cashew, Cotton, Cocoa, Tomato, Sugarcane, Millet, Cassava, Soya Bean, Maize, Beniseed, Palm Produce and Ginger. And solid minerals include Quartz, Limestone, Marble, Feldspar, Clay, Kaolin, Granite Rocks, Silica Sand and Dolomite.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">The Purchasers</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Analysing the global market size for the resources produced by Kwara state, it should interest the state to consider enlarging its production capacity to export each product or resource. For example, the world import market size of Corn (which is one of its major cash crops) is about $36.3bn with Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Vietnam, Spain, Egypt, Iran, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, China, and Malaysia as major purchasers. The import market share in Africa is about $3.73bn with Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, South Africa, Senegal, and Kenya as major buyers.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The state also produces Rice, and the world market share of Rice import is $24.7bn with Iran, China, Saudi Arabia, the Philippines, the United States, Iraq, Benin Republic, United Arab Emirates, Côte D&#8217;Ivoire, and France as major purchasers. The African import market share is $5.1bn with Benin Republic, Côte D&#8217;Ivoire, South Africa, Senegal, Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya and Mozambique as major buyers.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Kwara state also produces Cashew nuts and the world import market share for Cashew nuts (fresh or dried) is $7.46bn with, Vietnam, the United States, India, China, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates and France as major buyers. In Africa, the import is $83.1m with Ghana, South Africa, Egypt, Algeria, Togo, Tunisia and Morocco as major purchasers. There are other markets like that of cocoa beans, soybeans, raw sugar, and raw cotton that Kwara state can explore for exports as well.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">The Proposal</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">For Kwara State to experience tangible improvement in job creation in the state, there is a need to empower Small and Medium-scale Enterprises (SMEs). Given the commodities produced by the state, if SMEs oversee the entire value chain processes from production to harvesting and transportation, primary processing and storage, secondary processing and packaging, marketing and sales, logistics, export and distribution then there would be certain challenges encountered which would be in the form of inefficient value chain operators, low processing capacity and output, few jobs created, low-quality packaging, high production cost due to lack of economies of scale and prevalence of unexportable products. With a synergy between large Corporations and SMEs, these processes would be more efficient and there would be improvement which would take the form of efficient value chain operators, high processing capacity and increased output, low cost of production, good product quality and packaging, increased job creation, etc. The large corporations need to oversee two critical areas, and these are primary processing and storage, and secondary processing and packaging. While the SMEs can focus on handling production, harvesting and transport, marketing and sales, and logistics, export and distribution. Sticking to this arrangement would expand the participation of SMEs and improve the efficiency of their processes.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">To support exporters to enter markets in Africa, Europe and America securely and sustainably, Kwara state government should consider the following:</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">1. Partnering with a representative at the destination market to market and secure a contract.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">2. Setting up a warehouse (or warehouses) for pickup by both wholesalers and retailers at the destination market</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">3. Setting up an entity (agent or distributor) for the SMEs at the destination market</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">4. Partnering with an independent agent or distributor at the destination market</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">5. Organising and sponsoring manufacturers to exhibit their products in the destination market</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In summary, the state government should provide funds while the other entities provide expertise. After all necessary relationships and structures have been formed, the state government can agree with the SMEs on the export profit-sharing percentage.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">This model&#8217;s impact on the state government goes beyond the generation of revenue from exports; it has a huge significance on employment and improves economic activities in the state. With this model, economic diversification is achievable in Kwara state. The same model can be used by the federal government to diversify the economy, especially regarding solid minerals and agricultural produce exportation.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">The Profit</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Given the arable land available in Kwara state, if the state dedicates a part of this to the cultivation of profitable agricultural produce for export, given all associated costs from the cost of farming, to the cost of processing, the cost of exports, and the unit cost for each agricultural produce, multiplying this by the quantity produced and deciding on a fair selling price considering all necessary factors, the state government can realise a lot of revenue from the export of agriproducts. By implication, the state can increase its Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) significantly, fund more projects and incur less debt.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">See <a class="article-editor-content__link Hyperlink HyperlinkGateOff SCXW151773202 BCX0" href="https://youtu.be/GAG-W83HeLo?si=MSq1p0kSRNiQYuTk&amp;t=2827" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a> for a hypothetical visual representation and explanation of how Kwara state can make N285bn from the export of agriproducts (cashew).</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In conclusion, if we would diversify our economy, create more trade in Africa, grow our GDP, create employment, boost our foreign reserve, create wealth and reduce poverty, <strong>Aggressive Drive for Intra-Regional Trade is the Way to Go</strong>!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading article-editor-content__has-focus">The Preamble</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Kogi State, <em>the confluence state</em>, is rich in exportable products and mineral resources like wheat, sesame, ginger, uranium, etc, and is a predominantly agricultural State. The State is in the North Central geopolitical zone of Nigeria. It has 21 local government areas including Adavi, Ajaokuta, Ankpa, Bassa, Dekina, Ibaji, Idah, Igalamela-Odolu, ljumu, Kabba/Bunu, Koton Karfe, Lokoja, Mopa-Muro, Ofu, Ogori/Magongo, Okehi, Okene, Olamaboro, Omala, Yagba East, Yagba West with its capital in Lokoja.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Kogi state, like other states in Nigeria, should consider export for several reasons some of which include avoiding overdependence on federal allocations, fostering creativity and innovation, identifying and developing state competitive advantage, empowering the working population by creating more jobs, reviving the state economy, boosting the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the state, making farming and rural life more lucrative, and maximising the potential of indigenes in the diaspora.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Regardless of the poverty, unemployment, and frustration present in Kogi state like other states in Nigeria due to the inefficient management of state-owned resources, it is imperative to look beyond the challenges, seeing the growth potentials and opportunities for significant improvement that can come from efficient and effective utilisation of available resources.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">For Kogi state, there are opportunities in farming, mining and in the state’s population. With the level of unseriousness plaguing many states in Nigeria, cutting down on federal allocations might make the state governments more serious in the development of their states.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">The Peculiarities</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Kogi State was carved out of Kwara and Benue States on August 27, 1991 by the then regime of General Ibrahim Babangida. Its capital is Lokoja. The area which today forms Kogi State was a colonial formation then known as Kabba Province. The State is made up of the Igala, Kabba, Ebira and Kogi Divisions of the former Kabba Province.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Kogi State is the most centrally located of all the states of the federation. It shares common boundaries with Niger, Kwara, Nassarawa and The Federal Capital Territory to the north. To the east, the state is bounded by Benue state, to the south by Enugu and Anambra States, and to the west by Ondo, Ekiti and Edo states.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Lokoja, the Niger/Benue confluence town is the state capital. Ethnically, Yoruba, Nupe and Bassa form the main ethnic groups. Adavi, Ajaokuta, Ankpa, Bassa, Dekina, Ibaji, Idah, Igalamela-Odolu, ljumu, Kabba/Bunu, Koton Karfe, Lokoja, Mopa-Muro, Ofu, Ogori/Magongo, Okehi, Okene, Olamaboro, Omala, Yagba East, Yagba West are the LGAs in Kogi state. Kogi State is popularly called the confluence state because the confluence of Rivers Niger and Benue occurs there.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">With a total land area of 29,833 Km², Kogi state has a population of 4,750,115 of which 2,422,559 are male and 2,327,557 are female. The state has a tropical savannah vegetation and the major crops grown are Cassava, Rice, Cashew, Coffee, Cocoa, Palm Oil, Groundnuts, Maize, Yam and Melon. The solid minerals present in the state include Limestone, Iron Ore, Marble and Gemstone.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">There are four agricultural zones in Kogi state namely Aiyetoro-Gbede, Anyigba, Koton-karfe and Alloma. For Kogi State, investment opportunities exist in Agribusiness, Light Manufacturing, Healthcare, Business Process Outsourcing, Tourism, Energy and Mining.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The competitive advantages of Kogi State are in its cultivating 58% of the cashew trees in West Africa; well-irrigated of all-year farming; connection to 10 states; confluence of two rivers; purest deposits of iron ore in Nigeria; one of the states producing the largest palm oil in Nigeria.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In 2019, the state recorded an Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of N16.4bn and a budget of N176bn, implying that the state depends greatly on federal allocations and loans for its survival. In the same period, the unemployment rate in the state was about 38.97%, while about 28.81% were underemployed. With the opportunities available in Kogi state, the state can generate enough IGR to solve its internal problems as well as that of the federation, if the resources available in the state can be managed efficiently.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">The Profile</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In 2020, Kogi State recorded an IGR of N17.36bn and a Federal Allocation of N56.80bn. This by implication means Kogi state cannot survive without an allocation from the federal government which is the reason why the state must work towards tapping into the many resources present in the state. The state in 2020, had a domestic debt of about N68.09bn and foreign debt of about $30.2m and the growth in the state’s debt has been increasing over the years covered except for 2019. About 17.38% of the state’s revenue went to capital expenditure while the remaining 82.62% went to operating expenses. The IGR per capita of the state was N3,441, capital expenditure per capita was N2,785 and debt per capita was N15,772.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">According to the Budgit report of Nigerian states, The state, home to where the nation’s two largest rivers meet, flowed very briefly to one rank above its former position in the 2021 State Fiscal Performance Index, moving from 29th in 2020 to 28th in 2021. This movement may have been due to a modest reduction in its total recurrent expenditure for the 2019/2020 period. Total recurrent expenditure fell from N94.77bn in 2019 to N70.88bn, representing a 25.20% reduction. The largest reduction in the recurrent expenditure subcomponent happened with the ‘Social Benefits’ subhead, which declined by 59.53% from N25.60bn in 2019, to N10.36bn in 2020.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Kogi State recorded a significant shrinkage in its capital expenditure which reduced by 50.87% from N28.58bn in 2019 to N14.04bn in 2020: This translates to a very low capital expenditure per capita of N2,785 which is less than one-quarter of the national average per capita of N8,129. It was the 3rd lowest spender on capital expenditure, in 2020, across the federation- outdone only by Taraba and Benue.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Kogi grew its Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) by 5.91% from N16.38bn in 2019 to N17.35bn in 2020. Looking at the component performance of the state’s IGR, one observes that the bulk of the revenue came from ‘PAYE’, about N11.7bn in 2020. However, this was very similar to what the state earned in 2019- about N11.09bn. The next largest component came from ‘Other taxes’, which were N2.4bn in 2020, which had climbed from N1.33bn in 2019.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Its IGR per capita of N3,441 was also low, compared to the national average of N4,616 per capita. 25 states within the federation had an IGR per capita, less than the national average.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Considering the state’s recurrent revenue structure, an over-dependence on federation allocations is evident, with Kogi having 76.59% of its revenue from the federation and only 23.41% coming from the state. This is an unsafe fiscal position for the state and shows that Kogi has a lot of leeway to improve its internal revenue, by not only reducing its dependence but also expanding its fiscal space for capital and social sector projects.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The state’s debt profile is intriguing, as total debt stock had a year-on-year increase by 49.96% from N94.56bn in 2018 to N141.8bn in the 2019 fiscal year, but then shrank by 43.93% from N141.8bn in 2019 to N79.55bn in 2020 fiscal year. In comparison to its fellow sub-national units, Kogi is one of the 5 states in the federation with the lowest additions to their total debt stock.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">The Potential</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The majority of the people of the state are farmers. The State is blessed with suitable ecological and climatic conditions. It is, therefore, possible to produce various agricultural products including yam, cassava, soya bean, cocoyam, maize, millet, rice, guinea corn, palm produce, cowpea and others. The State’s rich agricultural endowment is reflected in its capacity to produce cash crops like cocoa, coffee and cashew.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Kogi State is also blessed with solid minerals. These include iron ore, mica, marble, limestone, coal, and crude oil. Others include; gold, kaolin, casserite, columbite, tantalite, feldspar and dolomite.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Significantly, the nation’s premier iron and steel complex is located at Ajaokuta. Industrially, Kogi State is an investors’ haven, the state has a number of Industrial ventures which include Ajaokuta Iron and Steel complex, Jakura Marble, Valley Food, Mopa Okura Sawmill, Idah Ceramic Company, oil palm Company, and Nigeria Iron-Ore Manufacturing Company.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Limestone and marble deposits are found in Ajaokuta, Jakura, Ososo, Osara, while Cassiterite, columbite and tantalite are found in Egbe. Gold is also found in Isanlu in East Yagba Local Government Area while Iron Ore can be found at Itakpe, Okene.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The proximity of the state to the federal capital territory (Abuja) and its rich mineral and agricultural resources, would certainly turn the state into a leading commercial centre in Nigeria soon.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">The Purchasers</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Analysing the global market size for the resources produced by Kogi state, it should interest the state to consider enlarging its production capacity to export each product or resource. For example, the world import market size of Corn (which is one of its major cash crops) is about $36.3bn with Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Vietnam, Spain, Egypt, Iran, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, China, and Malaysia as major purchasers. The import market share in Africa is about $3.73bn with Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, South Africa, Senegal, and Kenya as major buyers.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The state also produces Rice, and the world market share of rice import is $24.7bn with Iran, China, Saudi Arabia, the Philippines, The United States, Benin Republic and Iraq as major purchasers. The African import market share is about $6.06bn with Benin Republic, Cote D’Ivoire, South Africa, Senegal, Cameroon, Ghana and Kenya as major buyers.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Kogi state also produces Groundnuts and the world import market share for Groundnuts is $3.19bn with, China, Indonesia, the Netherlands, Vietnam, Germany, Russia, Mexico, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Japan as major buyers. In Africa, the import is $171m with Algeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda, Libya, Tunisia and Mozambique as major purchasers. There are other markets like that of cashew nuts, coffee, and cocoa beans that Kogi state can explore for exports as well.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">The Proposal</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">For Kogi State to experience tangible improvement in job creation, there is a need to empower small and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs). Given the commodities produced by the state, if SMEs oversee the entire value chain processes from production to harvesting and transportation, primary processing and storage, secondary processing and packaging, marketing and sales, logistics, export and distribution then there would be certain challenges encountered which would be in the form of inefficient value chain operators, low processing capacity and output, few jobs created, low-quality packaging, high production cost due to lack of economies of scale and prevalence of unexportable products. With a synergy between large Corporations and SMEs, these processes would be more efficient and there would be improvement which would take the form of efficient value chain operators, high processing capacity and increased output, low cost of production, good product quality and packaging, increased job creation, etc. The large corporations need to oversee two critical areas: primary processing and storage, and secondary processing and packaging. Meanwhile, SMEs can focus on handling production, harvesting and transport, marketing and sales, logistics, and export and distribution. Sticking to this arrangement would expand the participation of SMEs and improve the efficiency of their processes.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">To support exporters to enter markets in Africa, Europe and America securely and sustainably, Kogi state government should consider the following:</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">1. Partnering with a representative at the destination market to market and secure a contract.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">2. Setting up a warehouse (or warehouses) for pickup by both wholesalers and retailers at the destination market</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">3. Setting up an entity (agent or distributor) for the SMEs at the destination market</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">4. Partnering with an independent agent or distributor at the destination market</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">5. Organising and sponsoring manufacturers to exhibit their products in the destination market</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In summary, the state government should provide funds while the other entities provide expertise. After all necessary relationships and structures have been formed, the state government can agree with the SMEs on the export profit-sharing percentage.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">This model&#8217;s impact on the state government goes beyond the generation of revenue from exports; it has a huge significance on employment and improves economic activities in the state. With this model, economic diversification is achievable in Kogi state. The same model can be used by the federal government to diversify the economy, especially regarding solid minerals and agricultural produce exportation.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">The Profit</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Given the arable land available in Kogi state, if the state dedicates a part of this to the cultivation of profitable agricultural produce for export, given all associated costs from the cost of farming, to the cost of processing, the cost of exports, and the unit cost for each agricultural produce, multiplying this by the quantity produced and deciding on a fair selling price considering all necessary factors, the state government can realise a lot of revenue from the export of agriproducts. By implication, the state can increase its Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) significantly, fund more projects and incur less debt.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Preamble Kebbi State, the land of equity, is rich in exportable products and mineral resources like wheat, sesame, ginger, uranium, etc, [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading article-editor-content__has-focus">The Preamble</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Kebbi State, <em>the</em> <em>land of equity</em>, is rich in exportable products and mineral resources like wheat, sesame, ginger, uranium, etc, and is a predominantly agricultural State. The State is in the Northwest geopolitical zone of Nigeria. It has 21 local government areas including Aleiro, Arewa–Dandi, Argungu, Augie, Bagudo, Birnin Kebbi, Bunza, Dandi, Fakai, Gwandu, Jega, Kalgo, Koko / Besse, Maiyama, Ngaski, Sakaba, Shanga, Suru, Wasagu / Danko, Yauri, and Zuru with its capital in Birnin Kebbi.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Kebbi state, like other states in Nigeria, should consider export for several reasons some of which include avoiding overdependence on federal allocations, fostering creativity and innovation, identifying and developing state competitive advantage, empowering the working population by creating more jobs, reviving the state economy, boosting the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the state, making farming and rural life more lucrative, and maximising the potential of indigenes in the diaspora.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Regardless of the poverty, unemployment, and frustration present in Kebbi state like other states in Nigeria due to the inefficient management of state-owned resources, it is imperative to look beyond the challenges, seeing the growth potentials and opportunities for significant improvement that can come from efficient and effective utilisation of available resources.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">For Kebbi state, there are opportunities in farming, in mining and in the state’s population. With the level of unseriousness plaguing many states in Nigeria, cutting down on federal allocations might make the state governments more serious in the development of their states.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">The Peculiarities</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Kebbi was formed out of Sokoto State on August 27, 1991, by the General Ibrahim Babangida regime. Its capital is Birnin-Kebbi which is also one of its major towns including Birnin-Kebbi, Argungu and Yelwa.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">It lies in North-Western Nigeria, with its capital in Birnin Kebbi. In the fifteenth century, it became part of the Songhai Empire.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Kebbi State shares boundaries with Sokoto State on the North-Eastern axis, Zamfara State on the Eastern part, Niger State on the Southern part, Dosso Region in the Republic of Niger on the Northwest and the Republic of Niger on the West.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Kebbi State is divided into 21 local government areas, four emirate councils (Gwandu, Argungu, Yauri, and Zuru), and 35 districts. It derived its name from the 14th-century “KEBBI KINGDOM,” a province of the former Songhai Empire. Islam is the predominant religion.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">With a total land area of 36,800 Km², Kebbi state has a population of 4,724,046 of which 2,631,629 are male and 1,624,912 are female. The state has tropical savannah vegetation and the major crops grown are Millet, Wheat, Guinea corn, Rice, Onion, Groundnut, Cotton, and Maize. The solid minerals present in the state include Kaolin, Gypsum, Salt, Gold, Glassware and Marble. For Kebbi State, investment opportunities exist in Agribusiness, Light Manufacturing, Healthcare, Business Process Outsourcing, Tourism, Energy and Mining.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The competitive advantages of Kebbi State are in its rich agricultural land; major producer of rice; endowed with abundant natural resources (farmland, rivers, solid minerals like gold, limestone, manganese, etc.); new hub for agro commodities; abundant livestock; tourist attraction sites (Argungu Fishing Festival, the biggest fishing festival in the world).</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In 2019, the state recorded an Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of N7.4bn and a budget of N138bn, implying that the state depends greatly on federal allocations and loans for its survival. In the same period, the unemployment rate in the state was about 17.25%, while about 34.67% were underemployed. With the opportunities available in Kebbi state, the state can generate IGR enough to solve its internal problems as well as that of the federation, if the resources available in the state can be managed efficiently.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">The Profile</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In 2020, Kebbi State recorded an IGR of N13.78bn and a Federal Allocation of N54.65bn. This by implication means Kebbi state cannot survive without an allocation from the federal government which is why the state must work towards tapping into the many resources present in the state. The state in 2020, had a domestic debt of about N56.81bn and foreign debt of about $43.6m and the growth in the state’s debt has been increasing over the years covered except for 2019. About 42.75% of the state’s revenue went to capital expenditure while the remaining 57.25% went to operating expenses. The IGR per capita of the state was N2,741, capital expenditure per capita was N5,310 and debt per capita was N14,600.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">According to the Budgit report of Nigerian states, The Land of Equity, Kebbi with an estimated population of 5.03 million people enacted a N99.68bn revised budget in 2020, allocating N57.69bn and N41.99bn for capital and recurrent spending respectively; this implied a greater priority on capital expenditure than recurrent in its 2020 revised budget; however, in implementing the 2020 budget, the reverse was the case.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The state incurred the sum of N35.74bn on recurrent expenditure and N26.69bn on capital expenditure. Kebbi’s actual expenditure of N62.43bn in 2020 was 23% less than its 2019 total expenditure of N81.08bn. A trend analysis of Kebbi’s expenditure shows that the state’s capital expenditure has experienced a steady decline in recent years from N59.67bn in 2017 to N44.38bn in 2019 and N26.69bn in 2020.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Kebbi State’s capital spending in critical social sectors in 2020 significantly declined from what was spent in 2019: N2.92bn was spent by the Ministry of Education, N1.04bn by the Ministry of Higher Education, and N1.08bn by the Ministry of Health.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The State surpassed its 2020 Value Added Tax (VAT) projection of N12.07bn but did not meet its IGR projection of N10.49bn. It got the sum of N14.52bn as VAT and realized the sum N7.98bn from IGR.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Similarly, the state obtained a statutory allocation of N35.79bn and excess crude oil revenue of N773.54m. Taxes and indirect taxes formed 88.35% of what Kebbi generated as IGR in 2020. The State has a policy that allows MDAs to spend realized revenue at source without recourse to the appropriate quarters; this was listed as a limitation by the state’s Auditor General. This policy creates leakages in the system and provides an avenue for corruption to take place.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Having recorded a debt-to-revenue ratio of 114% and a debt service-to-revenue ratio way below the threshold of 40% in 2020, it can be inferred that Kebbi’s debt burden is still within sustainable limits. The state reduced its total debt burden by 11.30% from N82.73bn in 2019 to N73.38bn in 2020, thus ranking it among the top three states that scaled down their debt in 2020. Although the state did not incur any additional debt in 2020 to fund its budget, it spent the sum of N602m and N1.88bn on external loan repayment and internal loan repayment respectively in the same year.</p>

<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">The Potential</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Kebbi state has an agriculturally viable environment since it is endowed with high soil fertility, vast farmlands and economically viable rivers sheltered by fine tropical climate.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Owing to these factors, agriculture has remained the major source of revenue and indeed the backbone of the state&#8217;s economy.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Major food crops in the area are millet, guinea corn, maize, cassava, potatoes, rice, beans, onions and vegetables, while cash crops including wheat, soya beans, ginger, sugarcane, groundnuts and tobacco are also produced in the state. Similarly, fruits such as mango, cashew, guava and pawpaw are produced under horticulture.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Kebbi state has Kebbi Agricultural Development Authority which is responsible for the implementation of its agricultural policies.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Kebbi state is endowed with economically viable rivers such as the Niger and the Rima for the development of fisheries activities. Fishing has always been one of the key occupations of the inhabitants of the state.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Also, environmental factors as well as the largest concentration of cattle and other animals have made the state a basic raw materials source for dairy-products industries.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">The Purchasers</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Analysing the global market size for the resources produced by Kebbi state, it should interest the state to consider enlarging its production capacity to export each product or resource. For example, the world import market size of Corn (which is one of its major cash crops) is about $36.3bn with Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Vietnam, Spain, Egypt, Iran, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, China, and Malaysia as major purchasers. The import market share in Africa is about $3.73bn with Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, South Africa, Senegal, and Kenya as major buyers.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The state also produces Cotton, and the world market share of Cotton import is $53.6bn with China, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Turkey, Indonesia, Pakistan, India, Italy, Hong Kong, and Egypt as major purchasers. The African import market share is $5.1bn with Egypt, Nigeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Senegal, South Africa, Gambia, Mali and Benin Republic as major buyers.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Kebbi state also produces Groundnuts and the world import market share for Groundnuts is $3.19bn with, China, Indonesia, the Netherlands, Vietnam, Germany, Russia, Mexico, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Japan as major buyers. In Africa, the import is $171m with Algeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda, Libya, Tunisia and Mozambique as major purchasers. There are other markets like that of onions, wheat and rice that Kebbi state can explore for exports as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 class="article-editor-content__paragraph article-editor-content__has-focus"><em>The Preamble </em></h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Katsina State, <em>home of hospitality</em>, is rich in exportable products and mineral resources like soybean, cotton, onion, uranium, manganese, etc, and is predominantly an agrarian state. The State is in the Northwest geopolitical zone of Nigeria. It has 34 local government areas including Bakori, Batagarawa, Batsari, Bindawa, Baure, Charanchi, Dandume, Danja, Dan-Musa, Daura, Dutsinma, Dutsi, Faskari, Funtua, Ingawa, Jibia, Kafur, Kaita, Kankia, Kankara, Katsina and others with its capital in Katsina.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Katsina state, like other states in Nigeria, should consider export for several reasons some of which include avoiding overdependence on federal allocations, fostering creativity and innovation, identifying and developing state competitive advantage, empowering the working population by creating more jobs, reviving the state economy, boosting the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the state, making farming and rural life more lucrative, and maximising the potential of indigenes in the diaspora.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Regardless of the poverty, unemployment, and frustration present in Katsina state like other states in Nigeria due to the inefficient management of state-owned resources, it is imperative to look beyond the challenges, seeing the growth potentials and opportunities for significant improvement that can come from efficient and effective utilisation of available resources.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">For Katsina state, there are opportunities in farming, mining and in the state’s population. With the level of unseriousness plaguing many states in Nigeria, cutting down on federal allocations might make the state governments more serious in the development of their states.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><em>The Peculiarities </em></h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Katsina State was carved out of Kaduna State on September 1987 by the General Ibrahim Babangida regime. Its capital is Katsina.  From pre-colonial times to the present, Katsina state has always been the shining star of the North. It is not only the cultural pacesetter of the region; it is also the birthplace of the seven historic Hausa states that form the nucleus of what is today Northwestern Nigeria. The State is bounded in the East by Kano State, in the West by Sokoto State, in the South by Kaduna State and in the North by the Niger Republic.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Katsina State is the largest cotton producer in the country. It is made up of two emirates which feature prominently in the establishment of the seven Hausa Kingdoms.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The lineage between Bayajida and Daurama produced the founders of Daura, Katsina, Zaria, Kano, Rano Gobir and Biram. The legendary Kusugu well where the snake called Sarki was slain is one of the tourist attractions of Daura.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Katsina was founded by Kumayo and before the Fulani conquest had been an important seat of learning and a commercial centre of the trans-Saharan Trade. It provided one of the earliest education centres of the north.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Katsina State is bounded in the East by Kano and Jigawa States, in the West by Zamfara State, in the South by Kaduna State and in the North by the Niger Republic. The indigenes are Hausa and, Fulani.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">With a total land area of 24,192 Km², Katsina state has a population of 8,315,581 of which 4,240,946 are male and 4,074,635 are female. The state has a tropical savannah vegetation and the major crops grown are Cotton, Sorghum, Sugarcane, Tomato, Soybean, and Onion. The solid minerals present in the state include Basalt, Diamonds, Feldspar, Granite, Graphite, Gold, Iron-Ore, Kaolin, Manganese, Nickel, and Uranium. For Katsina State, investment opportunities exist in Agribusiness, Light Manufacturing, Healthcare, Business Process Outsourcing, Tourism, Energy and Mining.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The competitive advantages of Katsina State are in it being the largest producer of cotton, soybeans and sesame in Nigeria; 2nd largest producer of sorghum; major producer of cereals and legumes; 2nd largest tomato cultivating state; 2nd largest producer of hibiscus flower; largest Kaolin deposits in Nigeria.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In 2019, the state recorded an Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of N8.5bn and a budget of N244.8bn, implying that the state depends greatly on federal allocations and loans for its survival. In the same period, the unemployment rate in the state was about 25.28%, while about 23.54% were underemployed. With the opportunities available in Katsina state, the state can generate IGR enough to solve its internal problems as well as that of the federation, if the resources available in the state can be managed efficiently.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><em>The Profile </em></h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In 2020, Katsina State recorded an IGR of N11.40bn and a Federal Allocation of N65.20bn. This by implication means Katsina state cannot survive without an allocation from the federal government which is the reason why the state must work towards tapping into the many resources present in the state. The state in 2020, had a domestic debt of about N48.03bn and foreign debt of about $56.2m and the growth in the state’s debt has been fluctuating over the years covered except for 2019. About 23.33% of the state’s revenue went to capital expenditure while the remaining 72.08% went to operating expenses. The IGR per capita of the state was N1,291, capital expenditure per capita was N2,484 and debt per capita was N7,857.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">According to the Budgit report of Nigerian states, Nigeria’s 5th most populous state, Katsina, allocated N68.40bn to recurrent expenditure and N113.23bn to capital expenditure in its 2020 amended budget. However, the state was only able to implement 48.72% of the budget.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The state, with 19,971 persons on its payroll as at December 2020, expended N31.22bn on personnel cost in 2020. This was 104.15% of the N29.98bn set aside for personnel costs in the 2020 amended budget. Similarly, Katsina spent 81.59% of the N19.99bn allocated to overhead costs and N11.66bn, making 63.28% of the allocated sum, on consolidated revenue charges in 2020. Katsina state added 432 new personnel on its payroll between April and December 2020 and removed 1266 personnel from its payroll within the same period.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">However, despite having a net removal of 834 persons from its payroll between April and December 2020, Katsina State’s personnel cost grew by 19.48% from N26.13bn in 2019 to N31.22bn in 2020.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In the same vein, Katsina’s overhead cost was expected to drastically reduce compared to 2019 because the state was shut down for a couple of months during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and non-essential workers were asked to work from home. However, Katsina experienced a slight 0.9% decline in its overhead cost from N16.47bn in 2019 to N16.32bn.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In 2020, capital spending in critical social sectors of the Katsina economy was not prioritized. The state implemented poorly the capital budget for its economic sector, having disbursed only 12.82% of the allocated funds for the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, 10.33% of the allocated sum for employment and social intervention, and 18.21% of the funds set aside for capital spending in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Following a similar trend, out of the N15.43bn and N29.91bn allocated to the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health for capital expenditure in the 2020 amended budget of Katsina State, only N2.10bn and N1.28bn was disbursed to both Ministries respectively.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Capital expenditure usually entails spending on assets but interestingly, Katsina included debt servicing in its capital expenditure budget for 2019 and 2020; this is an anomaly compared to other states. Although Katsina increased its total debt profile by 44.88% from N49.81bn in 2018 to N90.36bn in 2019, it reduced its 2019 debt stock by 29.93% to N69.38bn in 2020.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><em>The Potential </em></h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The economy of the State is majorly agrarian with a cultivable 2.4 million hectares of land out of which 1.6 million is under cultivation, leaving a land area of 800,000 hectares, equivalent to one-third of the total cultivable land available for investment. The state also has over 61 water bodies suitable for irrigation farming with a capacity of 1121CU.m. The major water bodies with a combined water surface area of 558Cum are in Sabke, Jibia, and Gwaigwaye.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Farming and rearing of animals constitute the means of livelihood of about 80% of the population of the state. The state is a major collection centre for cash crops such as cotton, groundnut and food crops such as maize, guinea corn, millet, and vegetables. The range of livestock in the state is cattle, sheep, goat and poultry. These provide huge opportunities for setting up of large scale agro-allied industries such as sugar processing, rice milling, oil and flour milling, textiles, dairy production, confectioneries, meat processing, tannery, poultry production, etc.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The State has the following ranking in agricultural production and other business spaces in the country:</p>
<ul class="article-editor-content__bullet-list">
<li class="article-editor-content__list-item">
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The largest producer of cotton;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="article-editor-content__bullet-list">
<li class="article-editor-content__list-item">
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The second largest producer of sorghum;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="article-editor-content__bullet-list">
<li class="article-editor-content__list-item">
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Produces 13% of Nigeria’s sugarcane, placing it in second place</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="article-editor-content__bullet-list">
<li class="article-editor-content__list-item">
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In Nigeria, the World Bank ranked the State 7th in ease of doing business ahead of Lagos, Kano, Rivers and Cross Rivers;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="article-editor-content__bullet-list">
<li class="article-editor-content__list-item">
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The State ranks 12th in Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) development and growth;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="article-editor-content__bullet-list">
<li class="article-editor-content__list-item">
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The State was ranked 17th in Gross State Product with average per capita of $6,022; and the major producer of other cereals and legume crops.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Katsina state is blessed with abundant mineral resources that could be tapped for industrial growth. Prominent amongst these include lead, iron oxide, gold, iron ore, manganese, kaolin, silica sands, fire clay, asbestos, feldspars, mica, serpentine, gemstones, precious stones etc.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The availability of various types of crops cultivated in the state provided an opportunity for the setting up of agro-allied industries. As previously stated, cotton, beans, tomatoes, pepper, groundnut, millet, maize and guinea-corn are raw materials for various types of industries.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Leather and shoe manufacturing industries are feasible because of the availability in commercial quantity of hides and skin in all the nooks and corners of the state. Funtua textiles factory which employs over one thousand workers depends heavily on cotton being produced in Funtua, Bakori, Dandume, Sabuwa, Faskari, Danja, Dutsin-ma, Kurfi, Malumfashi and Kafur local government areas.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The availability of these raw materials offers wide-ranging opportunities for setting up of more commercial and industrial ventures in the state. The two oil mills situated in Katsina and Funtua depend on groundnut and cotton seed for their raw materials requirements.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><em>The Purchasers </em></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Analysing the global market size for the resources produced by Katsina state, it should interest the state to consider enlarging its production capacity to export each product or resource. For example, the world import market size of cotton (which is one of its major cash crops) is about $53.6bn with China, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Turkey, Indonesia, Pakistan, India, Italy, Hong Kong, and Egypt as major purchasers. The import market share in Africa is about $5.1bn with Egypt, Nigeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Senegal, South Africa, Gambia, Mali and Benin Republic as major buyers.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The state also produces Corn, and the world market share of Corn import is $36.3bn with, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Vietnam, Spain, Egypt, Iran, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, China, and Malaysia as major purchasers. The African import market share is $3.73bn with Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, South Africa, Senegal, and Kenya as major buyers.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Katsina state also produces Onion and the world import market share for Onion is $7.18bn with the United States, Indonesia, Vietnam, Germany, the United Kingdom, Malaysia, Brazil, the Netherlands, Japan, and Canada as major buyers. In Africa, the import is $318m with Senegal, Côte D&#8217;Ivoire, Guinea, Mauritania, Mozambique, Ghana, Congo DRC, Mali, and Angola as major purchasers. There are other markets like that of groundnut and raw sugar cane that Katsina state can explore for exports as well.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><em>The Proposal </em></h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">For Katsina State to experience tangible improvement in job creation in the state, there is a need to empower Small and Medium-scale Enterprises (SMEs). Given the commodities produced by the state, if SMEs oversee the entire value chain processes from production to harvesting and transportation, primary processing and storage, secondary processing and packaging, marketing and sales, logistics, export and distribution then there would be certain challenges encountered which would be in the form of inefficient value chain operators, low processing capacity and output, few jobs created, low-quality packaging, high production cost due to lack of economies of scale and prevalence of unexportable products. With a synergy between large Corporations and SMEs, these processes would be more efficient and there would be improvement which would take the form of efficient value chain operators, high processing capacity and increased output, low cost of production, good product quality and packaging, increased job creation, etc. The large corporations need to oversee two critical areas, and these are primary processing and storage, and secondary processing and packaging. While the SMEs can focus on handling production, harvesting and transport, marketing and sales, and logistics, export and distribution. Sticking to this arrangement would expand the participation of SMEs and improve the efficiency of their processes.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">To support exporters to enter markets in Africa, Europe and America securely and sustainably, Katsina state government should consider the following:</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">1. Partnering with a representative at the destination market to market and secure a contract.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">2. Setting up a warehouse (or warehouses) for pickup by both wholesalers and retailers at the destination market</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">3. Setting up an entity (agent or distributor) for the SMEs at the destination market</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">4. Partnering with an independent agent or distributor at the destination market</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">5. Organising and sponsoring manufacturers to exhibit their products in the destination market</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In summary, the state government should provide funds while the other entities provide expertise. After all necessary relationships and structures have been formed, the state government can agree with the SMEs on the export profit-sharing percentage.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">This model&#8217;s impact on the state government goes beyond the generation of revenue from exports; it has a huge significance on employment and improves economic activities in the state. With this model, economic diversification is achievable in Katsina state. The same model can be used by the federal government to diversify the economy, especially regarding solid minerals and agricultural produce exportation.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><em>The Profit </em></h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Given the arable land available in Katsina state, if the state dedicates a part of this to the cultivation of profitable agricultural produce for export, given all associated costs from the cost of farming, to the cost of processing, the cost of exports, and the unit cost for each agricultural produce, multiplying this by the quantity produced and deciding on a fair selling price considering all necessary factors, the state government can realise a lot of revenue from the export of agriproducts. By implication, the state can increase its Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) significantly, fund more projects and incur less debt.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">See <a class="article-editor-content__link Hyperlink SCXW97902788 BCX0" href="https://youtu.be/aQdgnZJBQlE?si=kiuMCp_1sMZbVHCp&amp;t=2867" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a> for a hypothetical visual representation and explanation of how Katsina state can make N316.2bn from the export of agriproducts (sesame seeds).</p>
