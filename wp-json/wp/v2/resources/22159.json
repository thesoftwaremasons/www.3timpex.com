It is also the first of its kind in the history<br>of the international trade sector in Nigeria. This edition has been able to unravel the root causes of the lack of<br>growth of non-export volume in Nigeria and provides insights into what needs to be done by the government,<br>banks, and other stakeholders in the industry to fix the problems.<\/p><p>The country is currently experiencing a very high level of inflation which has and has resulted in high cost of<br>living given that Nigeria is largely import-dependent. The consequent high rate of exchange of the Naira to major<br>foreign currencies used to pay for imported goods has made the cost of importation to be at all-time high.<br>It is no more news that export is the low hanging fruit that can help Nigeria increase its foreign exchange<br>generation. It is also important to state that exportation is the only means of generating foreign exchange that<br>the country has control over; and this is because other means of foreign exchange inflow like Foreign Direct<br>Investment, (FDI), Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI), are controlled by investors who want to do business in<br>Nigeria while the foreign remittances are controlled by Nigerians in diaspora who want to financially support their<br>friends and relatives at home in Nigeria.<\/p><p>This kind of report has become necessary because different people have varying opinions on the reason for the<br>low export volume from Nigeria; and this has made most efforts of the government not to yield the desired<br>results. This report has used a scientific methodology to determine the major factors hindering the growth of<br>export volume in Nigeria (particularly non-oil export) and proffers a comprehensive solution to the problems<br>through well-founded recommendations.<\/p><p><br>The objectives of the survey include: identifying the challenges of export business in Nigeria, knowing the level<br>of export trade finance rejection, understanding the reasons for export trade finance rejection, understanding<br>the features that characterized approved export trade finance requests, identifying the challenges faced by<br>exporters in getting their export trade finance requests approved, and recommending solutions that will address<br>the identified challenges associated with export trade finance rejection with the positive effect of reducing the<br>trade finance gap.<\/p><p>Some of the major findings of this annual trade finance survey include the following:<\/p><div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\"><div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:100%\"><ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>94% of exporters experienced rejection of their financing requests by Nigerian banks<\/li>\n\n<li>42% of rejected export finance requests were done without any reason given to the exporters<\/li>\n\n<li>21% of the rejected export financing requests were based on lack or inadequate collateral security<\/li>\n\n<li>Only 11% of exporters received approval for their export financing request<\/li>\n\n<li>57% of exporters identified access to export finance, port logistics and delays by government agencies<br>at the port as major challenges hindering export growth<\/li>\n\n<li>Only 22% of export financing requests were approved within one month of application<\/li>\n\n<li>59% of exporters were attracted to a bank that have support services for exporters<\/li><\/ul>\n\n<p>To get the full report, use the download button below.<\/p><\/div><\/div><div class=\"sdm_download_item \"><div class=\"sdm_download_item_top\"><div class=\"sdm_download_thumbnail\"><\/div><div class=\"sdm_download_title\">Annual Trade Finance Survey Report<\/div><\/div><div style=\"clear:both;\"><\/div><div class=\"sdm_download_description\"><\/div><div class=\"sdm_download_link\"><span class=\"sdm_download_button\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3timpex.com\/?sdm_process_download=1&download_id=22158\" class=\"sdm_download blue\" title=\"Annual Trade Finance Survey Report\" target=\"_self\">DOWNLOAD REPORT<\/a><\/span><span class=\"sdm_download_item_count\"><span class=\"sdm_item_count_number\">696<\/span><span class=\"sdm_item_count_string\"> Downloads<\/span><\/span><\/div><\/div><div class=\"sdm_clear_float\"><\/div>","protected":false},"featured_media":22165,"template":"","class_list":["post-22159","resources","type-resources","status-publish","has-post-thumbnail","hentry"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.3timpex.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/resources\/22159","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.3timpex.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/resources"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.3timpex.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/resources"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.3timpex.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/22165"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.3timpex.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=22159"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
