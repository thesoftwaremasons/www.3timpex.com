It is located in the Central African region, bothering countries like Cameroon Gabon, DR Congo<br \/>\nand the Atlantic ocean with its capital in Brazaville. Congo is not a landlocked country, it is blessed with a<br \/>\ncoastline of about 169km2 that houses two liner orts and a terminal port. The Congolese economy is largely dominated by oil production, which accounts for 80% of exports and 60% of domestic revenues (Coface). This oil<br \/>\ndependency makes the country vulnerable to shifts in commodity prices. Main Agricultural crops grown are<br \/>\nCassava, Sugar Cane, Oil Palm fruit, cassava leaves, Banana, Plantains, Root Tubers, Vegetables, mangoes<br \/>\nand Guava. In Congo, agriculture contributes to 9.6% of GDP and employs 34% of the active population (World<br \/>\nBank, 2020), most of whom practice subsistence farming. Though it possesses many fertile lands, only a minor part of these lands is cultivated (less than 10%).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"sdm_download_item \"><div class=\"sdm_download_item_top\"><div class=\"sdm_download_thumbnail\"><\/div><div class=\"sdm_download_title\">Republic of Congo<\/div><\/div><div style=\"clear:both;\"><\/div><div class=\"sdm_download_description\"><\/div><div class=\"sdm_download_link\"><span class=\"sdm_download_button\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3timpex.com\/?sdm_process_download=1&download_id=22581\" class=\"sdm_download blue\" title=\"Republic of Congo\" target=\"_self\">Download Now!<\/a><\/span><span class=\"sdm_download_item_count\"><span class=\"sdm_item_count_number\">171<\/span><span class=\"sdm_item_count_string\"> Downloads<\/span><\/span><\/div><\/div><div class=\"sdm_clear_float\"><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":22577,"template":"","class_list":["post-22580","resources","type-resources","status-publish","has-post-thumbnail","hentry"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.3timpex.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/resources\/22580","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.3timpex.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/resources"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.3timpex.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/resources"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.3timpex.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/22577"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.3timpex.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=22580"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
