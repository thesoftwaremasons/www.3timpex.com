It is located in the East African region, bothering countries like Somalia, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Yemen, Gulf of Aden and the red sea with its capital in Djibouti city. It is not a land-locked country, it is blessed with a coastline of about 314km2 that houses one liner ports and a terminal port. About 80% of Djibouti&#8217;s annual port traffic is tied to Ethiopia, Djibouti can benefit from its neighbour&#8217;s con-tinued economic recovery, but the downside is that Dji-bouti will also remain vulnerable to possible disruptions due to political instability in the Tigray region (Coface).<br \/>\nMain agricultural products include Fruits, Vegetables, sheep, goat camels and animal hides. In Djibouti, Industry accounts for a fifth of the Djibouti gross domes-tic product as agriculture plays a much lesser impact on the economy. The tertiary activity contributes to more than 80% of Djibouti&#8217;s wealth (world bank).<\/p>\n<div class=\"sdm_download_item \"><div class=\"sdm_download_item_top\"><div class=\"sdm_download_thumbnail\"><\/div><div class=\"sdm_download_title\">Djibouti<\/div><\/div><div style=\"clear:both;\"><\/div><div class=\"sdm_download_description\"><\/div><div class=\"sdm_download_link\"><span class=\"sdm_download_button\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.3timpex.com\/?sdm_process_download=1&download_id=22591\" class=\"sdm_download blue\" title=\"Djibouti\" target=\"_self\">Download Now!<\/a><\/span><span class=\"sdm_download_item_count\"><span class=\"sdm_item_count_number\">226<\/span><span class=\"sdm_item_count_string\"> Downloads<\/span><\/span><\/div><\/div><div class=\"sdm_clear_float\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":22590,"template":"","class_list":["post-22592","resources","type-resources","status-publish","has-post-thumbnail","hentry"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.3timpex.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/resources\/22592","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.3timpex.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/resources"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.3timpex.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/resources"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.3timpex.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/22590"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.3timpex.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=22592"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
