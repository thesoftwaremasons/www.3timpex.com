Its capital is Benin City. Situated in the mid-south-west region of the country, Edo State covers 17,802 square kilometres. The State has 18 Local Government Areas (LGAs) which include Akoko-Edo, Egor, Esan Central, Esan North-East, Esan South-East, Esan West, Etsako Central, Etsako East, Elsako West, Igueben, Ikpoba-Okha, Oredo, Orhionmwon, Ovia North-East, Ovia South-West, Owan East Owan West and Uhunmwonde.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The State is home to several ethnicities including the Otuo, Bini, Esan, Akoko, Igarra, Ora, Ijo and Afemai people. Edo State is renowned for its proficiency in sports and athletics and a culture of intellectual edification and scholastic excellence. It also shares boundaries with three other states of the federation. It is bounded on the north and the east by Kogi State, on the west by Ondo State and on the south by Delta State. Generally, it is a low-lying area except in the north where it is marked by undulating hills. The main towns in the state are Benin, the capital of the ancient Benin kingdom which is also the state capital, Ubiaja, Auchi, Ekpoma and Uromi.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Edo State is referred to as the \u201cheartbeat of Nigeria\u201d and is located in the South-South geo-political zone of Nigeria. With a population of 4,470,605 of which 2,280,008 are male and 2,190,596 are female, Edo State is an oil-producing state and is one of the nine Niger Delta states in Nigeria. It has rich rainforest vegetation interspersed with hills as well as a rich cultural heritage that makes it a tourist destination. The State is also endowed with a wide variety of mineral resources, arable land for cash crops and has the largest oil palm yields in Nigeria. It has both a Tropical Savannah and Monsoon vegetation.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The major crops produced in Edo state include Rubber, Oil Palm, Cassava, Rice, Cocoa, Banana and Cashew.

For Edo state, Investment opportunities exist in Agribusiness, Light Manufacturing, Healthcare, Tourism, Energy, and Mining.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The competitive advantages of Edo State are its highest oil palm yields in Nigeria; huge deposits of peculiar stones (limestone, ceramics, marble, granite and gypsum); a leading producer of timber in Nigeria; its national museum is a major tourist centre in Nigeria; it is one of the commercial rubber producing states; it has 2+ million hectares of arable land reserved for farming; it is a hub for electricity generation. In 2019, the state recorded an Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of N29.5bn and a budget of N179bn, implying that the state depends greatly on federal allocations and loans for its survival. In the same period, the unemployment rate in the state was about 49.02%, while about 15.86% were underemployed. With the opportunities available in Edo state, the state can generate IGR enough to solve its internal problems as well as that of the federation, if the resources available in the state can be managed efficiently.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 aria-level=\"4\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">The Profile<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:80,&quot;335559739&quot;:40,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In 2020, Edo State recorded an IGR of N27.18bn and a Federal Allocation of N65.16bn. This by implication means Edo state cannot survive without an allocation from the federal government which is the reason why the state must work towards tapping into the many resources present in the state. The state in 2020, had a domestic debt of about N80.79bn and foreign debt of about $280.3m and the growth in the state\u2019s debt has been fluctuating over the years. About 40.28% of the state\u2019s revenue went to capital expenditure while the remaining 59.74% went to operating expenses. The IGR per capita of the state was N5,761, capital expenditure per capita was N8,659 and debt per capita was N39,694.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">According to the Budgit report of Nigerian states, the heartbeat of the nation suffered a significant blow to its revenue due to fiscal shocks induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Its IGR declined by 7.78% from N29.48bn in 2019 to N27.18bn in 2020. However, the state could still conveniently cover its operating expenses and make loan repayments by using its total revenue, without resorting to borrowing. Edo State comes in 9<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">th<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> position in the 2021 Fiscal Performance Ranking, up from 13<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">th<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> position in 2020.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Edo state is still highly dependent on federally distributed revenue, contributing about 70% of its total recurrent revenue. This state needs to do more to change this dynamic as shocks to the federal government revenues in a post-COVID-19 world would significantly affect its spending plans. In 2020, reduced federally collected revenue, IGR and capital receipts had a knock-on effect on Edo\u2019s actual capital expenditure which dipped by 31.42% from N63.47bn in 2019 to N43.54bn in 2020. Citizens and civil society are encouraged to ensure that expenditures received by the different government agencies as reported in the state\u2019s audit report translate to value for money and tangible projects on the ground.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Further analysis of the state\u2019s capital expenditure indicates that: \u2018Govt. House &amp; Protocol (GHP)\u2019 received N17.26bn from the total 2020 actual capital expenditure, up 444.63% from the N3.17bn it got in 2019. N16.28bn from this amount was spent by \u2018Govt. House &amp; Protocol (GHP) on Road &amp; Infrastructure contracts. This is in addition to the N7.37bn spent on Roads and Infrastructure by the State\u2019s Ministry of Infrastructure for the year 2020. In contrast, the state\u2019s Ministry of Health received only N709m, down 70.48% from the actual N2.4bn capital expenditure it got in 2019. The Ministry of Education suffered a similar fate as its capital spending was cut by -93.64% from N13.91bn received in 2019 to N884m in 2020.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Fiscal constraints on the revenue side also led to a decline in the state\u2019s operating expenses by -14.1% from N75.22bn in 2019 to N64.60bn in 2020. The biggest components affected include \u2018Social Benefits\u2019 which saw a 31% reduction, from N14.48bn in 2019 to N10.05bn in 2020 and \u2018Overhead costs\u2019 which was slashed by -31% from N29.04bn in 2019 to N20.086bn in 2020 according to data from the State\u2019s Auditor General\u2019s report.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">With an external debt of $280.30m, up by 1.58% from $275.93m in 2019, Edo State has the 3<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">rd<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> largest external debt in the country, making its fiscals one of the most exposed to risks from exchange rate volatility. Year-on-year, the state\u2019s total debt burden grew by a modest 4.00% from N180.10bn in 2019 to N187.30bn in 2020, significantly influenced by a volatile exchange rate regime which saw a devaluation of the naira from N305.9\/$1 in 2019 to N380\/$1 in 2020: further bloating the size of its external debt component in naira terms.

The vegetation belts of the state can be generalized into: Fresh Water Swamp, Lowland Rain Forest and Derived Savanna. The State is endowed with favourable climatic conditions and ecological conditions that have given ground to a blossoming agricultural sector. (Subsistence farming). The state enjoys almost nine months of rainfall in the southern part of the state. The state\u2019s weather can be classified into two seasons: rainy season starting from April to October and dry season from November to March with a cold harmattan spell between December and January.

Given the commodities produced by the state, if SMEs oversee the entire value chain processes from production to harvesting and transportation, primary processing and storage, secondary processing and packaging, marketing and sales, logistics, export and distribution then there would be certain challenges encountered which would be in the form of inefficient value chain operators, low processing capacity and output, few jobs created, low-quality packaging, high production cost due to lack of economies of scale and prevalence of unexportable products. With a synergy between large Corporations and SMEs, these processes would be more efficient and there would be improvement which would take the form of efficient value chain operators, high processing capacity and increased output, low cost of production, good product quality and packaging, increased job creation, etc. The large corporations need to oversee two critical areas, and these are primary processing and storage, and secondary processing and packaging. While the SMEs can focus on handling production, harvesting and transport, marketing and sales, and logistics, export and distribution. Sticking to this arrangement would expand the participation of SMEs and improve the efficiency of their processes.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">To support exporters to enter markets in Africa, Europe and America securely and sustainably, the Edo state government should consider the following: <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Partnering with a representative at the destination market to market and secure a contract.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Setting up a warehouse (or warehouses) for pickup by both wholesalers and retailers at the destination market\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Setting up an entity (agent or distributor) for the SMEs at the destination market\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Partnering with an independent agent or distributor at the destination market\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Organising and sponsoring manufacturers to exhibit their products in the destination market\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In summary, the state government should provide funds while the other entities provide expertise.
