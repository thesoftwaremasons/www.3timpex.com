										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Entrepreneurship has been a recurring discourse in economic discussions globally. Underemployment and unemployment issues plaguing many countries have called for the need for a solution. And many people have found the solution in entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Consequently, being an employer of labor or investor is increasingly becoming attractive. There is, however, the issue of finding it difficult to choose the venture to go into. Some people desire to start a business or invest in one but struggle to make a decision and the main point of being an entrepreneur is doing the right business.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-10395 size-medium" src="http://www.3timpex.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/start-ginger-export-business-in-nigeria-300x150.png" alt="how to start ginger exporting business in nigeria" width="300" height="150" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.3timpex.com/2017/07/29/exporting-business-in-nigeria/">Exportation is one business</a> that quite a number of people, unfortunately, do not consider. But exportation is actually is actually a lucrative business because Nigeria has a lot of products that are in high demand in foreign countries. One of such products is Ginger. Ginger is a root herb that is not only useful for domestic purposes; it is also used for industrial purposes. Ginger is a natural herb that is in high demand due to its aromatic, nutritional and medicinal benefits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Is Ginger Good for Exporting?</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, many people erroneously think ginger is only useful for domestic purposes but ginger has industrial value as well and used for the production of many things. Many of the industries in different countries demand ginger to be used for as a raw material in the production of their products. It is, in fact, one of the items Nigeria is blessed with that is ready for export.</p>
<p>According to Nigeria Export Statistics, 23% to the country’s GDP comes from ginger export. Food and confectionaries companies use ginger for their biscuits, drinks, sweets among others. The oil of ginger is also extracted from drugs, perfumes, foods, and drinks. So yes, on the question of whether ginger is good for exporting or not, the answer is yes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Countries You Can Export Ginger To</strong></p>
<p>There are many countries that demand ginger. Many countries such as the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Poland and others in Europe demand for ginger in high quantity. Apart from all the industrial and domestic uses of ginger, it is highly demanded mostly during winter because of the effect on cold. Ginger is not only good for a cold weather, it is also good for a sore throat, common cold and general cold that is usually common during winter in Europe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How To Start Ginger Export Business:</strong></p>
<p>Have you decided to start exporting ginger? Then there are certain things you need to know and do. Before you learn the ropes of exporting ginger, remember if you want to simply invest because you have a large amount of cash lying around and want it to generate income for you, you can get a partner who will do the work while the profit will be shared between you too or you could invest in an already existing business.</p>
<p>However, if you are interested in being actively involved in the establishment and running of the business, then here is information to get you started.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Research</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Before starting any business at all, it is important to do research so you can prepare for some avoidable challenges. Of course, there are many things you would not be able to learn till you actually start the business. But so you can concentrate on those and also avoid what is avoidable, you need to so both theoretical and practical research. There are certain entrepreneurs who served as apprentices for others before they established their own business, you can do the same.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Get Capital</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>No business can run without capital, that is a given already. Luckily, starting a ginger business is quite cheap compared to setting out in other businesses. Apart from the money that will be spent registering for the businesses and getting all other required documents, you will also need capital for transportation both from the suppliers and to the buyers. Buying ginger itself for a ton can go for about N200,000 to N250,000.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Register Your Business</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Registering your business is another very important step you need to take if you want to set out because it will not only protect you, it will increase the credibility of your business. The truth is many foreigners have distrust for Nigerians because of their impression and so they will not likely want to do business with an unregistered company. Plus, it will save you from the hassles you are likely to face with the government. CAC (Corporate Affairs Commission) is the government organization saddled with the responsibility of registering businesses.</p>
<p>As a small and medium business, you will simply need to register your business name and probably private limited company. There are certain steps to take when registering your business with the government.</p>
<ul>
<li>To start with, you have to get a business name. To save yourself a lot of back and forth with CAC, it is important to have a name on the ground first before visiting because if another business is bearing the name, it will be rejected. Luckily, before visiting CAC, one can check their website for a list of registered companies to determine if a name is available or not. You should probably have two or three names so you can have options and besides, you will be allowed to submit an alternative name at CAC.</li>
<li>After getting your business name(s), you will visit the CAC office close to you, get a form and be required to fill. You will fill in the usual details as well as your business name (first choice and alternative), then the type of business you are registering. It is advisable you make a photocopy of the form before submitting the original. Then you will need to check back at a later date to check that the name is available and approved.</li>
<li>Once approved, you will need to go to CAC again to register to get a business registration form. Some other documents will be required from you (you can find out from CAC or on their website online). To submit with the form.</li>
<li>After submission, attestation form will be given to you to sign at a magistrate court.</li>
<li>You will be required to submit all these with a token.</li>
<li>You should also register with NEPC (Nigerian Export Promotion Council). Not only will it also increase your credibility, you get to associate with the exporters’ community and be eligible to all the benefits that come from that.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Find Your Suppliers</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Once the above is taken care of, the next thing you need to do is to find your suppliers. There are certain things you should consider when trying to find a supplier. They include distance, quality of the product and the price. If you can get all these things at once, then you have found your supplier. One thing you shouldn’t compromise on, however, is the quality. Most of the countries you will be exporting to have a standard on the kind of quality they allow be imported into the country. So if you want to ensure you keep getting request, then you should make sure you only buy quality ginger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can you find suppliers? This is quite easy. Ginger is produced in a high quantity in Kaduna state. However, other states like Benue, Nassarawa, and Gombe also produce ginger in large quantity. If you want to get directly from the farmers at a cheaper rate, then you can scout farms in these states or you can buy from the market in your own state. It depends on which you find more convenient.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Find International Buyers</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You cannot successfully run a business without having buyers and in this case, international buyers. There are different ways to get buyers for your goods. Luckily, Nigerian ginger is actually a preferred type of ginger because of its flavor, spice, and oil. So the attraction of Nigerian ginger has already given you a head start.</p>
<ul>
<li>One good way to get buyers is a good old internet. The internet is home to many things; the good, the bad and the ugly. For an exporter like yourself, you can use the internet to search for buyers of ginger abroad.</li>
<li>You can also get buyers by attending international trade fairs. NEPC organizes some that are a good meeting point for buyers and sellers.</li>
<li>Another way is to liaise with Nigerians living abroad. It is either they serve as your scout who will help you scout the market over there or they serve as your partner in the business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t forget to do a research around the market to determine the international price before setting your own price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Other Logistics</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have secured your buyer(s), there are other logistics you have to take care of.</p>
<ul>
<li>Packaging and storing your goods should be done with the ginger in mind. You have to store in a way that will not bring damage to your product.</li>
<li>Documentations like invoices, receipts, shipping documents, bill of lading, certificate of origin and other documents required by Nigeria and the country imported to should be cleared and settled.</li>
<li>It is also important to take care of insurance in case of any loss.</li>
<li>The goods should be labeled not necessarily with the name of the business but the details of the product and other important export details to identify the products.</li>
<li>Take an inventory to determine your revenue and income in order to plan for the next sale.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ginger exporting business is a lucrative business that does not need too much money to start. The above information will help you get started. However, there is more that will be learned from people who have experience of the business or even as you go ahead.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Nigeria is currently ranked one of the top producers of cassava globally, therefore it is expected that cassava exporting from Nigeria one [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nigeria is currently ranked one of the top producers of cassava globally, therefore it is expected that cassava exporting from Nigeria one of the export business people can engage in.</p>
<p>As of 2017, it is estimated that Nigeria <a href="http://cassavaexport.tripod.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">produced over 47million tonnes of cassava annually</a>, making it a lucrative as export business.</p>
<p>Therefore if you are thinking of which export business to engage in but you not quite sure, then looking into the cassava exporting industry can be a good option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many reasons for this. One is the fact that cassava is our thing is Nigeria; so finding suppliers will not be difficult. Cassava is also in high demand in various countries outside our shores, therefore, finding an exporting partner is also not difficult.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many reasons for the demand for cassava. One reason for that is the fact that cassava is used as a source of different kinds of food and even livestock feeds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cassava also serves as raw material in the industry for the production of products like dextrose lactose and adhesive bakery products among others. Again, it is used in for the production of drugs and cosmetics as well as a source of energy for some people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Nigeria, any export of any kind is good for the economy because it will increase the circulation of foreign currency and be useful for stabilizing our Naira.</p>
<p>So anyway we look at it, cassava exportation is a good business for you and the country as a whole.<br />
However, just like every other venture that one engages in, there are procedures that will make your journey easier. There are certain things to you have to do if you want to be an exporter of cassava in Nigeria.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is research. The internet is a good place to start but it is not enough. You need to go to the market as well to see how it is done practically. One effective way you can do this is interned with someone who is already in the business.</p>
<p>You can work for free if they are not willing to pay, after all, you simply need knowledge. However, the internet is also a good place to learn. You can find consultants who give <a href="http://www.3timpex.com/import-export-products-2-2/">import business trainin</a>g to as many as are interested. Before you even start at all, it is important to have all the knowledge available, so you have an idea of everything it entails; capital, human resources, intricacies, legal aspect and contacts.</p>
<p>The next thing is capital. It is unnecessary to talk about how important it is to have your capital down because what business is there that can survive without capital.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are different ways to get capital for your business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Of course, the first obvious option is your savings. Most times, before people go into business, they take time to have gathered enough from their personal income. The only most reliable person to finance your business is yourself.</p>
<p>• Another good option is your family and friends. They are the next set of people who know you and can be willing to take a risk on you. Of course, in most cases, you would have to have proved yourself to be a reliable person and worth the risk. If your family know you as a flighty or inconsistent person, they might not be as willing to help out. So it is important that your reputation with your family is untainted before you even go outside.</p>
<p>• Loans are another good way to source for funds. But whatever you do, make sure it is minimal. Don’t go overboard with getting loans. There are government loans and organizations that give loans to businesses or even investors who are looking for where to put their money. You will have to convince all of these people by writing a business proposal in some cases or just pleading your case.</p>
<p>• Before considering loans, you could apply for grants from the government or non-governmental organizations that are into all these.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, you will need to register your business. In order to have credibility both in and out of the country, your business has to be government-registered. With the number of fraud trending these days, the foreigners will not take you seriously if you do not have the stamp of the government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So to get started, you need to find a unique name and register with the <a href="https://services.cac.gov.ng/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC)</a>. They are the body responsible for registering businesses in Nigeria. The reason you need your business name to be unique is that they will reject a business name that is already in existence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to avoid back and forth with CAC, think of the name or even do your own research on the internet to find if the name you are gunning for exists. Then you need an office address; it could be your house address but it must be an address that exists physically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you are done with CAC, you need to also register with the <a href="http://nepc.gov.ng/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC)</a> because your business is an exporting business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NXP form will be required by the Nigerian Customs Service. You are expected to register this form with a bank to set up and maintain a domiciliary account for you where your payments will be deposited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will need to obtain all the necessary licenses and permits required by the government. These documents are also important in determining your credibility to your buyers. You will need a good lawyer to guide you in all you need.<br />
You will also need to obtain licenses from the country you plan to sell to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The country will likely need to inspect your products to make sure they meet their standards, so research their standards, make sure all round your cassava is of standard and research all the country will require you to get before you can start exporting to their country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When all the legal aspects, licenses and permits are gotten, then you need to find your supplier(s). There are a good number of suppliers who also have farms, so they produce the cassava they export.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also do that if you have the resources. If not, you can go into the villages to find suppliers of standard cassava at an affordable price. You can also have more than one supplier to be safer to have a higher quantity when you get more demands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, you need to find buyers. This is one aspect that many people find difficult. The internet has made things a lot easier. You can research for buyers of cassava in different countries. However, many have been victims of fraud and you would want to save yourself that. Here are some ways you can find buyers for your business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• As mentioned earlier, you can find buyers on the internet. Sites like alibaba.com have a number of people who register interest of buying cassava. So you can try them. You can also simply just search for buyers on Google. However, make sure you do proper research on the companies or buyers who reach out to you or you find. Watch out for their email address; serious companies usually have company email and not the personal email address. Check their scam reports on the internet. You can type the name of the company and type scam with it, it will bring it out if there is any scam report about them because usually, you are not the first person. Research their activities to see if they are legit. All these will reduce your chances of being scammed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• You can also advertise on the internet either by having a website or advertising on a forum, so when buyers research, they can find you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• You can find buyers through an agent. There are many export agency companies who serve as a middleman between buyers and sellers, so you can check them out. They will increase your expenditure but it is usually a small price to pay. You can also use someone you have in the country you want to export to or have a partner in the other country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• If you have enough money, you can travel to the country you wish to export to and scout the environment yourself as well to find buyers. Speaking to them personally will go a long way as well.</p>
<p>• Another option is attending trade fairs. Attending international trade fairs will help you find buyers and speak to them personally, so it is a good option to consider. That is also why it is necessary to register with NEPC. They usually organize fairs , where buyers and sellers can meet and register,will give you a pass to attend and advertise yourself to potential buyers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you have found your buyer(s) and discussions have been finalized, always remember that quality is very important to these foreigners. As much as possible don’t compromise on quality. Don’t cut down quality because of more profit, at the end of the day, you will be doing your business more harm than good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also make sure you package them properly so they can reach the destination in good form. The usual packing materials are sacks of cotton, multi-craft paper bags or clean jute bags.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This information is for you to get started as a cassava exporter in Nigeria. Knowledge is very important in any business and the above information will go a long way in helping you get started.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s been growing interest among several Nigerians about the<a href="http://www.3timpex.com"> export business in Nigeria</a> This is likely because it’s one of the businesses in Nigeria that have been considered as highly profitable over time.</p>
<p>Plus <a href="http://www.3timpex.com/2017/07/29/exporting-business-in-nigeria/">starting an export business</a> is a kind of business that is not limited by the boundary. It cuts across many countries, therein providing a larger market for exports.</p>
<p>Exportation of products is a great opportunity for businesses to increase their sales potential. If you are a medium or large scale business owner who already has a wide reach within the local market, you may want to consider going into exportation.</p>
<p>Besides, the local markets are becoming saturated and thus may become restrictive and be limiting for your business.</p>
<p>Hence you may want to explore new opportunities in the international markets and expand your business by searching for new markets abroad that you can sell your products to.</p>
<p>However, for you to be able to legally participate in export transactions in Nigeria, you will be required to obtain an export license.</p>
<p>It is therefore important that you understand what an export license is and how you can get one.</p>
<p>Even if you do not consider it necessary to obtain one; with ample information about it, you may just decide to initiate the process of securing one for yourself or perhaps assist someone else who is looking to obtain one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What is an Export License?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An export license is a certificate that gives you the authorization to embark on the certain type of export transaction.</p>
<p>This means that an exporter, looking forward to successfully carry out export transactions, will be required by law to have an export license.</p>
<p>Having this license will, therefore, grant you the permission to legally carry out a shipment of commodities which are approved by the government. The government agency in Nigeria responsible for granting and issuing this license is the Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC).</p>
<p>This government agency has the responsibility of issuing out export licenses for the exportation of agricultural commodities and manufactured goods.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>How can I get an Export License in Nigeria?</strong></p>
<p>To obtain an export license, you should first ensure that have a legally registered limited liability company with a registered office in Nigeria.</p>
<p>This is because you will be required to provide details about your company when registering for your export license.</p>
<p>Once that is confirmed, then proceed to log on to the NEPC website: <a href="http://www.nepc.gov.ng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.nepc.gov.ng</a> or visit any of the NEPC offices to commence, your registration and application.</p>
<p>During your registration process online, kindly ensure that you have your company’s certification of Incorporation and Memorandum and Articles of Association as you may be required to upload them online.</p>
<p>You will also be charged a fee which will be confirmed once you commence the registration/application process.</p>
<p>As at the time of this writing, the cost of registration for a new export license is 13,500 Naira. However, if you will like your license sent via courier then an additional fee of 2,500 Naira will be charged.</p>
<p>On completion of your registration, the license is usually ready within 72 hours. However, if there are delays of any sort, it will likely take much longer.</p>
<p>You can also do a verification of your license at any of the NEPC or via their online platform.</p>
<p>The license issued to you by the NEPC gives permission for the exportation of products like cashew nuts, ginger roots, cocoa, charcoal, and others.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if your interest is in the exportation of solid materials, you will be required to obtain a different license from the Federal Ministry of Solid Minerals Development. In this case, a fresh registration will be required at their office before you can be issued a license.</p>
<p>With this information on your fingertips, you are now a step ahead to initiate the process for obtaining your export license or better yet guiding someone who needs one but is clueless on how to begin.</p>

<p>First is your readiness. Whereas snail export is lucrative but just like any other business, you need to be ready to work.</p>
<p>Laziness will not cut it if you actually want to make a meaningful return at the end of the day. You have to count your cost before you start building your home.</p>
<p>Now, that is not simply talking about financial readiness. While that is necessary, the mental and emotional readiness is important. You have to understand, before starting the business, that you will give in your all and be ready to push on if you are meant with challenges on the way.</p>
<p>The next thing is to prepare. It is similar to the above but they are quite different. Whereas the above is more mental, preparedness is physical and material.</p>
<p>Equip yourself with any and all information that would help your business. Luckily, we are in the information age now and there is practically anything that is not on the internet.</p>
<p>All you need is good network and a gadget. The information you need is a click away. However, whether we like it or not, some things are better experienced because experience really is the best teacher, so you will need to acquaint yourself with people who have been in the business before you.</p>
<p>Ask them any and every question you know would help and be ready to learn. In fact, there are many people who have heard to work under another, so as to learn under them because some things you cannot learn on the internet. Theoretical knowledge cannot be compared to practical knowledge.</p>
<p>Then, to fully get started, you will need to register your business. If you want to make your business big and you want to ensure trust with your international partners, then they need the assurance of a registered business.</p>
<p>These foreigners will be reluctant to hear whatever you have to say if your business is not recognized by the Nigerian government. Registration makes them feel you are legit.</p>
<p>However, not registering can also, firstly, affect you in the terms of importing and exporting because you will be dealing with the customs office. And secondly, it can limit all legal actions if your business is not registered. Luckily, things are getting easier and the bureaucracy involved to get your business registered is not as bad as it used to be. Visit the <a href="http://new.cac.gov.ng/home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Corporate Affair Commission (CAC)</a>  for more information on how to go about registering a business.</p>
<p>One thing that usually delays getting your business registered is getting a business name.</p>
<p>Some people spend months on it because their business name keeps getting rejected. So make sure you think about a unique name before attempting to register.</p>
<p>After getting the registration with CAC, you will also need to get a license from the Nigeria Export Promotion Council (NEPC).</p>
<p>Considering you will be exporting out of the country, you have to get licensed before you are allowed to export, especially, when you want to export in large quantity or land a large contract with an international buyer.</p>
<p>When all the legalities are all taken care of, you will need to find suppliers for your snail.</p>
<p>Suppliers for snail are quite easy to come by, especially in our country, because as mentioned earlier, Nigeria is a large producer of a snail.</p>
<p>All you will need to do is find the suppliers and that you can do by either going online to source for them yourself or speaking to people who have been in the business ahead of you if you know anyone of them.</p>
<p>Now, remember that you should not go with a supplier at first glance. Of course, if they come highly recommended, you can consider them.</p>
<p>But you need to be sure they will give you a quality product for good service before deciding to go with them.</p>
<p>Remember your business with the foreigner is based on trust and you will not want to lose customers due to errors from your suppliers.</p>
<p>Before making a choice on which supplier to go with, ask yourself some pertinent questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>like how is their service?</li>
<li>how is their product (the snails)?</li>
<li>do they keep to their word?</li>
<li>do they respond swiftly?</li>
<li>do they delay supply?</li>
<li>what is the cost?</li>
</ul>
<p>These and more are some of the questions you need to ask yourself before committing to a supplier.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you could also start your own farm. Starting a snail farm is not so expensive, luckily, and when you learn all the ropes, it will serve you better than getting from a supplier.</p>
<p>Snails lay eggs, so reproduction is in more quantity. Understand, however, that you should only consider starting a snail farm if you are sure you will have the time and energy to it. If not, buying from other snail farmers to exporting is also profiting.</p>
<p>After you have gotten suppliers, you need to find foreign buyers. It might be hard to believe but demand for snail in the international market is at the present, higher than supply. So you can find your way in quite easily.</p>
<p>The first point of contact is the internet. One can easily find all forms of information on the internet these days and you need is patience and dedication. You can check for restaurants, especially African restaurants in these foreign countries and contact them.</p>
<p>You can also seek for herbal companies, especially in Asian countries, who would need the snail as part of their mixture. Or you can simply just find snail buyers in different countries.</p>
<p>Now, understand that although the internet is full of useful information, it is also full of junk, and so you cannot afford to feed off everything you see there. You need to carefully sift the information and separate the wheat from the chaffs.</p>
<p>The problem with falling for the chaff is that they might be on the outlook for whom to swindle, so you need to be careful there and be discerning.</p>
<p>Another way of getting buyers is through international trade fairs and fairs organized by organizations like the NEPC (Nigeria Export Promotion Council).</p>
<p>That is why it is important to identify with them. Make sure you attend and make contacts even if they do not go with you at that moment or tell you they already have a supplier. Keep contacts, it can work in your favor one day.</p>
<p>Then you can also get information from people who have gone ahead of you in the business. This might be quite tricky because it is rare for people to hand valuable information to the competition. But there is no harm in trying. And some have also written materials that come at a price for the information you seek.</p>
<p>Once you have gotten your suppliers and you have contacted them and all is in place for supply, some people try to handle export themselves but it might be quite strenuous.</p>
<p>Find a freight forwarder for shipment. They are well informed about the requirements and procedures as well as the all the payments and duties required at the air and seaport.</p>
<p>So you will not have to go through the stress of possibly making mistakes when you need to supply your goods. Remember that before shipping, you need to package your products well to avoid spoilage while in transit.</p>
<p>From the above, it is clear how lucrative snail export and even more interesting is that it is not too expensive to start. If you are thinking of the business of you, then you can consider the snail export.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-9847 size-medium" src="http://www.3timpex.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Raw-cashew-nuts-300x226.jpg" alt="how to export cashew nuts and product profile information" width="300" height="226" /></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Cashew (<strong><em>Anacardium Occidentale L.</em></strong>) is a tree crop of considerable economic importance to Nigeria and other tropical countries. Apart from being a source of useful products and byproducts for food, medicinal and industrial applications, cashew gives also a useful shade, while ornamental and alley trees are suitable for the control of soil erosion, particularly for the protection of watersheds and dams.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Harvest:</strong> Cashew nut setting begins in the middle of dry season, while harvesting takes place mainly in February or March. The entire harvest period occupies about 16 weeks. In the Eastern and Western parts of the country, where quality cashew nuts are grown, nuts are allowed to drop to the ground before they are collected. This practice ensures that only ripe nuts are collected. Nuts normally fall to the ground with their apples attached; the two are normally separated by a twisting action during collection. The remnants of the apple flash adhering to the nuts are removed with a sharp knife. After picking, the nuts are dried in the sun for 2 to 3 days, to reduce their moisture content to about 12 %. Properly dried nuts are packed in jute bags and can be kept for 6 to 10 months if stored in suitable condition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Locations:</strong> Major cashew growing areas in Nigeria are, by order of importance: Enugu, Abia, Imo, Anambra, Ebonyi and Cross River States in the eastern part of the country; Oyo, Osun, Ondo, Ekiti and Ogun States in the Western part, as well as Kwara, Kogi, Nassarawa, Benue, Taraba, Niger and FCT in the Middle Belt and also Sokoto and Kebbi States in the North West part of the country. The majority of export quality nuts come from the Western and Eastern parts of the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Specification:</strong> According to SGS (quality inspectors), the standard for raw cashew nuts, unshelled, is specified as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nut count 180-200 per kg</li>
<li>Moisture content 8-10% max</li>
</ol>
<p>iii. Defective nuts 15% max</p>
<ol>
<li>Float Rate 18% max</li>
<li>Admixture 0.25% max</li>
<li>Foreign matter 0.25% max</li>
</ol>
<p>vii. KoR, or shelling out-turn 48-50 Ibs/bag</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Uses: </strong>Cashew nut is a popular snack, and its rich flavor means that it is often eaten on its own, lightly salted or sugared. In addition to this, cashew nutshell liquid (CNSL), a by-product of processing cashew, is mostly composed of anacardic acids. These acids have been used effectively against tooth abscesses due to their lethality to bacteria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Export market:</strong> The major buyers of cashew nut from Nigeria are mainly India and Singapore. Smaller percentage goes to Europe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Export price: </strong>The export Free on Board (FOB) price of raw cashew nut varies from about USD 900-1300/MT. However, when an exporter adds value to this product by processing it into kernels, the FOB price could quadruple that of raw cashew nut.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Local price:</strong> The local price per metric tonne MT for raw cashew nuts delivered EXW Lagos (delivered in Lagos) varies from NGN250,000.00 during the peak season to about NGN350,000.00 at the off season.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-9850 size-medium" src="http://www.3timpex.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/sesame-seed-300x223.jpg" alt="how to export sesame seed" width="300" height="223" /></p>
<p><strong>Description: </strong>Sesame seeds (or sesamum or benniseed) are the seeds of the tropical annual <em>Sesamum Indicum</em>. The species has a long history of cultivation, mostly for its yield of oil. The original area of domestication of sesame is obscure but it seems likely to have first been brought into cultivation in Asia or India. The plant is usually 60 to 120cm tall and the fruit is a dehiscent capsule held close to the stem. When ripe, the capsule shatters to release a number of small seeds. The seeds are protected by a fibrous ‘hull’ or skin, which may be whitish to brown or black depending on the variety. 1000 seeds weigh some 4-8g. The seeds have a high oil content of 44-60%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Harvest: </strong>Harvesting begins in late December and continues through July. Each producing area stated in the next section below (Locations) has only one season.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Locations:</strong> The major producing areas in order of priority are Nasarawa, Jigawa and Benue States. Other important areas of production are found in Yobe, Kano, Katsina, Kogi, Gombe and Plateau States. The major marketing centers (towns and states) of sesame seeds in Nigeria are in the table below.</p>

<p><strong>Types/Varieties:</strong> There are 2 types of sesame produced in Nigeria</p>
<ol>
<li>White/raw = Food-grade used in bakery industry. 98-100% whitest grade seeds.</li>
<li>Brown/mixed = primarily oil-grade.</li>
</ol>
<p>The White (Food Grade) seed is grown around the towns of Keffi, Lafia/Makurdi, Doma, and in Nassarawa, Taraba, and Benue States. It is easier to sort and the Fumani/Denin people consume sesame locally. The Brown/mixed grows in the North, in Kano State and in Jigawa State near Hadejia, and somewhat in the southern part of Katsina State.</p>

The United States is the fifth largest import market with a steady demand for over 50,000 tonnes per year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Export Price: </strong>The export Free on Board price of sesame seed varies from USD 1500 -2000/MT depending on the type and form of the sesame seed and the negotiation made with the buyers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Local price: </strong>local price per metric tonne MT of sesame seed varies from NGN450,000.00 to about NGN550,000.00 in Kano.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> Charcoal is the blackish residue consisting of impure carbon obtained by removing water and other volatile constituents from animal and vegetation substances. Charcoal is usually produced by slow pyrolysis, i.e. the heating of wood, sugar, bone char, or other substances in the absence of oxygen. The resulting soft, brittle, lightweight, black, porous material resembles coal and is 85% to 98% carbon with the remainder consisting of volatile chemicals and ash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Harvest:</strong> Hard wood charcoal can be produced year round. However it generally advised that charcoal production and export should be done during the dry season (from November to May). Production and export of charcoal during the raining season could be rejected by buyers because of the high moisture content (more than 10%) that usually characterized the charcoal produced during this period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Location: </strong>Charcoal can be produced from different part of the country especially in the South West region (Oyo, Ogun, Ondo, Ekiti e.t.c), South-South and South-Eastern part of the country (Enugu, Rivers, Cross River e.t.c) and also in the middle belt (Kwara, Kogi, Abuja and Benue) area of the country.</p>

<p>Size:                                           20-120mm</p>
<p>Carbon:                                     65%-80%</p>
<p>Moisture content:                   8% max</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Uses:</strong> Charcoals are widely used for outdoor grilling and barbecues in backyards and on camping trips. it‘s also used for House-Heating. Historically, charcoal was used in great quantities for smelting iron and later in blast furnaces and finery forges.</p>
